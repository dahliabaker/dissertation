abstract = {The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect may spin up or spin down 5-km-radius asteroids on a 108-year timescale. Smaller asteroids spin up or down even faster due to the radius-squared dependence of the YORP timescale. The mechanism is the absorption of sunlight and its re-emission as thermal radiation from an irregularly shaped asteroid. This effect may compete with impacts and tidal encounters as a way of changing rotation rates for small asteroids, especially in the near-Earth region. The YORP effect may explain the rapid rotation of 1566 Icarus and the slow tumbling of 4179 Toutatis. It may explain to some extent the slow rotation of 253 Mathilde. Meteoroids spin up or down on timescales fast compared to their cosmic ray exposure ages. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that asteroids between {\~{}}100 m and {\~{}}100 km in size may be gravitational aggregates of loosely consolidated material. Recently evidence has been mounting to support this idea. Comet breakups, crater chains, doublet craters, giant craters, grooves, asteroid spins, underdense asteroids, asteroid satellites, and unusual asteroid shapes can all be explained to some degree by the properties of aggregate structures. Moreover, laboratory and numerical experiments indicate that solid asteroids, if they existed, would likely be completely shattered by now, owing to their violent collisional histories. Once shattered, a body becomes increasingly difficult to disrupt since it can efficiently absorb energy deposited at the impact site. In this chapter we present the evidence for gravitational aggregates and discuss the implications of their existence for asteroid evolution. We also propose a new classification scheme for asteroid structure parameterized by fundamental quantities such as strength and porosity.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of computing visual hulls from image contours. We propose a new hybrid approach which overcomes the precision-complexity trade-off inherent to voxel based approaches by taking advantage of surface based approaches. To this aim, we introduce a space discretization which does not rely on a regular grid, where most cells are ineffective, but rather on an irregular grid where sample points lie on the surface of the visual hull. Such a grid is composed of tetrahedral cells obtained by applying a Delaunay triangulation on the sample points. These cells are carved afterward according to image silhouette information. The proposed approach keeps the robustness of volumetric approaches while drastically improving their precision and reducing their time and space complexities. It thus allows modeling of objects with complex geometry, and it also makes real time feasible for precise models. Preliminary results with synthetic and real data are presented.},

abstract = {The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect has been recently suggested to significantly change, on a long-term, rotation state of small asteroids and meteoroids. Though YORP is closely related to the Yarkovsky (orbital) effect, it differs from the latter in two aspects: (i) YORP needs bodies of irregular shape to be effective, and (ii) YORP acts on bodies of zero surface thermal conductivity. To simplify computations, YORP has been so far investigated in the zero surface thermal conductivity limit only. Here we analyze the role of the surface conductivity and we find it substantially changes previous conclusions. Most importantly, unlike in the zero-conductivity limit, (i) YORP preferentially tilts obliquity toward two asymptotic states perpendicular to the orbital plane, and (ii) YORP asymptotically decelerates and accelerates rotation rate in about equal number of cases. Our work also indicates that direct detection of the YORP effect for a small asteroid may significantly constrain its mass. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

The asteroid's orthogonal axes are 535, 294, and 209 meters, the mass is 3.51 × 1010 kilograms, and the estimated bulk density is 1.9 ± 0.13 grams per cubic centimeter. The correspondence between the smooth areas on the surface (Muses Sea and Sagamihara) and the gravitationally low regions suggests mass movement and an effective resurfacing process by impact jolting. Itokawa is considered to be a rubble-pile body because of its low bulk density, high porosity, boulder-rich appearance, and shape. The existence of very large boulders and pillars suggests an early collisional breakup of a preexisting parent asteroid followed by a re-agglomeration into a rubble-pile object.},

These mechanisms help to (a) deliver asteroids (and meteoroids) with diameter D {\textless} 40 km from their source locations in the main belt to chaotic resonance zones capable of transporting this material to Earth-crossing orbits; (b) disperse asteroid families, with drifting bodies jumping or becoming trapped in mean-motion and secular resonances within the main belt; (c) modify the rotation rates and obliquities of D {\textless} 40 km asteroids; and (d) allow asteroids to enter into spin-orbit resonances, which affect the evolution of their spin vectors and feedback into the Yarkovsky-driven semimajor axis evolution.

abstract = {The YORP effect is produced when the surface of a small object in interplanetary space is heated by sunlight and reradiates the absorbed energy in thermal wavelengths. The absorbed, reflected, and emitted photons produce tiny torques on the small body that can change its spin rate and obliquity over planetary timescales. Previous theories of the YORP effect relied on numerical or seminumerical evaluation of the radiation torques. Here we develop an alternative approach and calculate the YORP torques analytically. Our theory is limited to near-spherical objects. While unsuitable for a precise determination of torques on elongated and/or highly irregular objects, the analytic theory helps to explain several general properties of the YORP torques that were identified in previous numerical works. For example, we demonstrate that the component of the YORP torque that affects the spin rate, ¯s, can vanish for obliquity values  55 (and  125 ). As discussed by Vokrouhlicky´ and coworkers, this property of ¯s is important for establishing the so-called Slivan states, which arise as evolutionary end states of spin vectors of small solar system bodies such as asteroids. We show that ¯s (averaged over spin and orbit periods) is a second-order quantity in the small parameter that describes the deviation of the shape from an ideal sphere. We calculate ¯s explicitly as polynomials of cos . These expressions show that the YORP torque arises from coupled deformations of the body's shape in topographic longitude and latitude. Moreover, by introducing a small phase lag to mimic the delay between the absorption and reemission of photons we demonstrate that ¯s is insensitive to the exact value of the surface thermal conductivity. These and other analytic results described here provide a baseline for understanding the YORP effect on bodies with more complicated surface shapes and properties other than the ones considered here. We discuss applications of the analytic theory on near-spherical asteroids like 1998 KY26 and on more elongated and/or irregular objects like (1862) Apollo and (25143) Itokawa.},

The current derivation goes beyond previous discussions published in the literature and provides a comprehensive secular dynamical analysis of the effect of solar radiation torques acting on a uniformly rotating body, and the evolution of its rotation state over time. Our predicted model has the global radiation properties of the asteroid as explicit parameters, and hence can be specified independent of these parameters. The resulting secular equations for the rotation rate and rotation pole are characterized by three parameters of the body's shape and explicitly includes the effect of thermal inertia on the evolution of these rotation state parameters. With this detailed model, in conjunction with estimated asteroid shapes and poles, we compute the expected YORP torques and dynamic response of several asteroids and the change in rotation rate for specific shapes as a function of obliquity. Finally, we define a convenient dimensionless parameter that is only a function of the body geometry and that can be used to characterize the effects of YORP. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The surface of asteroid 25143 Itokawa is covered with numerous boulders although gravity is very small compared with that of other asteroids previously observed from spacecraft. Here we report the size-frequency statistics of boulders on the entire surface of Itokawa. based on high-resolution images (1 pixel ∼0.4 m) obtained by the Hayabusa spacecraft. There are 373 boulders larger than 5 m in mean horizontal dimension on the entire surface - 0.393 km2 - and the number density is nearly 103/km2. The cumulative boulder size distribution on the entire surface has a power-index of -3.1 ± 0.1. For the east and west sides and the head and body portions of Itokawa, the power-index of the size distributions and the number densities of boulders of these areas are thought to be similar from the statistical point of view. A global mapping of boulders shows that there is no apparent correlation in the locations of boulders and craters. The ratio of the total volume of the boulders to the total excavated volume of the craters on Itokawa is ∼25{\%} when only craters larger than 50 m in mean diameter are considered, and this ratio is extremely larger than that on Eros and the Moon, respectively. The origin of boulders on the surface of Itokawa was examined quantitatively by calculating the number of boulders and the size of the largest boulder using a model based on impact cratering experiments. The result indicated that the boulders on the surface of Itokawa cannot solely be the product of craters. Our results suggest that the boulders originated from the disruption of the larger parent body of Itokawa, as has been described in previous papers (Fujiwata et al., Science, 312, 1330-1334, 2006; Saito et al., Science, 312, 1341-1344, 2006).

This effect has important implications for spin dynamics of diameter D ≲ 50 km asteroids. In our previous work we developed an analytic theory for the component of the YORP torque that affects the spin rate. Here we extend these calculations to determine the effect of the YORP torque on obliquity. Our theory is limited to objects with near-spherical shapes. Two limiting cases are studied: (1) immediate emission of the thermal energy that occurs for surface thermal conductivity K = 0; (2) the effects of K ≠ 0 in the limit of small temporal variations of the surface temperature. We use the linearized heat transport equation to model (2). The results include explicit scaling of the YORP torque on obliquity with physical and dynamical parameters such as the thermal conductivity and spin rate. The dependence of torques on the obliquity is given as series of the Legendre polynomials. Comparisons show excellent agreement of the analytic results with the numerically calculated YORP torques for objects such as asteroids 1998 KY26 and (66391) 1999 KW4.

The principal data output is an ensemble of landmark maps (L-maps), high-resolution topography/albedo maps of varying resolution that tile the surface of the body. Because they can have a resolution comparable to the best images, and can be located on a global reference frame to high accuracy, L-maps provide a significant improvement in discriminatory power for studies of small bodies, ranging from regolith processes to interior structure. These techniques are now being used to map larger bodies such as the Moon and Mercury. L-maps are combined to produce a standard global topography model (GTM) with about 1.57 million vectors and having a wide variety of applications. They can also be combined to produce high-resolution topography maps that describe local areas with much greater detail than the GTM. When combined with nominal predictions from other data sources and available data from other instruments such as LIDAR or RADAR, solutions for the spacecraft position and camera pointing are the most accurate available. Examples are drawn from studies of Phobos, Eros, and Itokawa, including surface characterization, gravity analysis, spacecraft navigation, and incorporation of LIDAR or RADAR data.

abstract = {Radiation recoil (YORP) torques are shown to be extremely sensitive to small-scale surface topography, using numerical simulations. Starting from a set of "base objects" representative of the near-Earth object population, random realizations of three types of small-scale topography are added: Gaussian surface fluctuations, craters, and boulders. For each, the expected relative errors in the spin and obliquity components of the YORP torque caused by the observationally unresolved small-scale topography are computed. Gaussian power, at angular scales below an observational limit, produces expected errors of order 100{\%} if observations constrain the surface to a spherical harmonic order l ≲ 10. For errors under 10{\%}, the surface must be constrained to at least l = 20. A single crater with diameter roughly half the object's mean radius, placed at random locations, results in expected errors of several tens of percent. The errors scale with crater diameter D as D2 for D {\textgreater} 0.3 and as D3 for D {\textless} 0.3 mean radii. Objects that are identical except for the location of a single large crater can differ by factors of several in YORP torque, while being photometrically indistinguishable at the level of hundredths of a magnitude. Boulders placed randomly on identical base objects create torque errors roughly 3 times larger than do craters of the same diameter, with errors scaling as the square of the boulder diameter. A single boulder comparable to Yoshinodai on 25143 Itokawa, moved by as little as twice its own diameter, can alter the magnitude of the torque by factors of several, and change the sign of its spin component at all obliquities. Most of the total torque error produced by multiple unresolved craters is contributed by the handful of largest craters; but both large and small boulders contribute comparably to the total boulder-induced error. A YORP torque prediction derived from groundbased data can be expected to be in error by of order 100{\%} due to unresolved topography. Small surface changes caused by slow spin-up or spin-down may have significant stochastic effects on the spin evolution of small bodies. For rotation periods between roughly 2 and 10 h, these unpredictable changes may reverse the sign of the YORP torque. Objects in this spin regime may random-walk up and down in spin rate before the rubble-pile limit is exceeded and fissioning or loss of surface objects occurs. Similar behavior may be expected at rotation rates approaching the limiting values for tensile-strength dominated objects. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Context. The asteroid 25143 Itokawa is one of the candidates for the detection of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect in the rotation period. Previous studies were carried out up to the 196 608 facets triangulation model and were not able to provide a good theoretical estimate of this effect, raising questions about the influence of the mesh resolution and the centre of mass location on the evolution the rotation period. Aims. The YORP effect on Itokawa is computed for different topography models up to the highest resolution Gaskell mesh of 3 145 728 triangular faces in an attempt to find the best possible YORP estimate. Other, lower resolution models are also studied and the question of the dependence of the rotation period drift on the density distribution inhomogeneities is reexamined. A comparison is made with 433 Eros models possessing a similar resolution. Methods. The Rubincam approximation (zero conductivity) is assumed in the numerical simulation of the YORP effect in rotation period. The mean thermal radiation torques are summed over triangular facets assuming Keplerian heliocentric motion and uniform rotation around a body-fixed axis. Results. There is no evidence of YORP convergence in Gaskell model family. Differently simplified meshes may converge quickly to their parent models, but this does not prove the quality of YORP computed from the latter. We confirm the high sensitivity of the YORP effect to the fine details of the surface for 25 143 Itokawa and 433 Eros. The sensitivity of the Itokawa YORP to the centre of mass shift is weaker than in earlier works, but instead the results prove to be sensitive to the spin axis orientation in the body frame. Conclusions. Either the sensitivity of the YORP effect is a physical phenomenon and all present predictions are questionable, or the present thermal models are too simplified. {\textcopyright} 2009 ESO.},

The model describes the spin-state evolution in Deprit-Elipe variables, first-order averaged with respect to rotation and Keplerian orbital motion. Assuming zero conductivity, the YORP torque is represented by spherical harmonic series with vectorial coefficients, allowing us to use any degree and order of approximation. Within the quadrupole approximation of the illumination function we find the same first integrals involving rotational momentum, obliquity and dynamical inertia that were obtained by Cical{\'{o}} {\&} Scheeres. The integrals do not exist when higher degree terms of the illumination function are included, and then the asymptotic states known from Vokrouhlick{\'{y}} et al. appear. This resolves an apparent contradiction between earlier results. Averaged equations of motion admit stable and unstable limit cycle solutions that were not previously detected. Non-averaged numerical integration by the Taylor series method for an exemplary shape of 3103 Eger is in good agreement with the semi-analytical theory. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

Under certain conditions, the western sides of stones appears to be on average slightly warmer than their eastern sides, thus experiencing stronger recoil force and increasing the rotation rate of the asteroid. We study this effect, called the tangential YORP effect, in a toy model, replacing stones with walls and simulating heat conductivity in them. We discuss general trends of the effect, estimate its magnitude, and find it to be comparable to the normal YORP effect determined by gross-scale asymmetry of the asteroid. The existence of this effect would modify the predictions of the YORP acceleration of asteroids. In some cases, equilibrium between tangential and normal components of YORP is possible, resulting in a large number of asteroids expected to have no net YORP acceleration, which can be the case for Itokawa. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {It is now becoming widely accepted that photon recoil forces from the asymmetric reflection and thermal re-radiation of absorbed sunlight are, together with collisions and gravitational forces, primary mechanisms governing the dynamical and physical evolution of asteroids. The Yarkovsky effect causes orbital semimajor axis drift, and the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect causes changes in the rotation rate and pole orientation. We present an adaptation of the Advanced Thermophysical Model to simultaneously predict the Yarkovsky and YORP effects in the presence of thermal-infrared beaming caused by surface roughness, which has been neglected or dismissed in all previous models. Tests on Gaussian random sphere shaped asteroids, and on the real shapes of asteroids (1620) Geographos and (6489) Golevka, show that rough surface thermal-infrared beaming enhances the Yarkovsky orbital drift by typically tens of percent but it can be as much as a factor of 2. The YORP rotational acceleration is on average dampened by up to a third typically but can be as much as one-half. We find that the Yarkovsky orbital drift is only sensitive to the average degree, and not to the spatial distribution, of roughness across an asteroid surface. However, the YORP rotational acceleration is sensitive to the surface roughness spatial distribution, and can add significant uncertainties to the predictions for asteroids with relatively weak YORP effects. To accurately predict either effect the degree and spatial distribution of roughness across an asteroid surface must be known. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {In addition to collisions and gravitational forces, it is now becoming widely acknowledged that photon recoil forces and torques from the asymmetric reflection and thermal re-radiation of sunlight are primary mechanisms that govern the rotational evolution of an asteroid. The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect causes changes in the rotation rate and pole direction of an irregularly shaped asteroid. We present a simple Monte Carlo method to estimate the range of YORP rotational accelerations acting on a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) without knowledge of its detailed shape, and to estimate its detectability using light-curve observations. The method requires knowledge of an asteroid's orbital properties and size, and assumes that the future observational circumstances of an asteroid have already been thought through. It is verified by application to the observational circumstances of the seven YORP-investigated asteroids, and is then applied to 540 NEAs with NEOWISE and/or other diameter measurements, and to all NEAs using Minor Planet Center Orbit absolute magnitudes. The YORP detectability is found to be a strong function of the combined asteroid orbital and diameter properties, and is independent of the rotation period for NEAs that do not have very fast or slow rotation rates. The median and 1$\sigma$ spread of YORP rotational acceleration expected to be acting on a particular NEA (d$\omega$/dt in rad yr-2) can be estimated from its semimajor axis (a in au), eccentricity (e) and diameter (D in km) by using |d$\omega$/dt| = 1.20+1.66-0.86 × 10-2(a2 √ 1-e2D2)-1 and/or by using |d$\omega$/dt| = 1.00+3.07-0.81 × 10-2(a2 √ 1-e2D2)-1 if the diameter is instead estimated from the absolute magnitude by assuming a geometric albedo of 0.1. The length of a light-curve observational campaign required to achieve a 50 per cent probability of detecting the YORP effect in a particular NEA (TCAM{\_}50 in yr) can be estimated by using TCAM{\_}50 = 12.5(a2 √ 1-e2D2)1/2 and/or by using TCAM{\_}50 = 13.7(a2 √ 1-e2D2)1/2 for an absolute-magnitude-estimated diameter. To achieve a 95 per cent YORP-detection probability, these last two relations need to be multiplied by factors of {\~{}}3.4 and {\~{}}4.5, respectively. This method and approximate relations will be useful for astronomers who plan to look for YORP rotational acceleration in specific NEAs, and for all-sky surveys that may serendipitously observe NEA light curves.{\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We explore methods to detect and characterize the internal mass distribution of small bodies using the gravity field and shape of the body as data, both of which are determined from orbit determination process. The discrepancies in the spherical harmonic coefficients are compared between the measured gravity field and the gravity field generated by homogeneous density assumption. The discrepancies are shown for six different heterogeneous density distribution models and two small bodies, namely 1999 KW4 and Castalia. Using these differences, a constraint is enforced on the internal density distribution of an asteroid, creating an archive of characteristics associated with the same-degree spherical harmonic coefficients. Following the initial characterization of the heterogeneous density distribution models, a generalized density estimation method to recover the hypothetical (i.e., nominal) density distribution of the body is considered. We propose this method as the block density estimation, which dissects the entire body into small slivers and blocks, each homogeneous within itself, to estimate their density values. Significant similarities are observed between the block model and mass concentrations. However, the block model does not suffer errors from shape mismodeling, and the number of blocks can be controlled with ease to yield a unique solution to the density distribution. The results show that the block density estimation approximates the given gravity field well, yielding higher accuracy as the resolution of the density map is increased. The estimated density distribution also computes the surface potential and acceleration within 10 {\%} for the particular cases tested in the simulations, the accuracy that is not achievable with the conventional spherical harmonic gravity field. The block density estimation can be a useful tool for recovering the internal density distribution of small bodies for scientific reasons and for mapping out the gravity field environment in close proximity to small body's surface for accurate trajectory/safe navigation purposes to be used for future missions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Tangential YORP, or TYORP, has recently been demonstrated to be an important factor in the evolution of an asteroid's rotation state. It is complementary to normal YORP, or NYORP, which used to be considered previously. While NYORP is produced by non-symmetry in the large-scale geometry of an asteroid, TYORP is due to heat conductivity in stones on the surface of the asteroid. To date, TYORP has been studied only in a simplified one-dimensional model, substituting stones with high long walls. This article for the first time considers TYORP in a realistic three-dimensional model, also including shadowing and self-illumination effects via ray tracing. TYORP is simulated for spherical stones lying on regolith. The model includes only five free parameters and the dependence of the TYORP on each of them is studied. The TYORP torque appears to be smaller than previous estimates from the one-dimensional model, but is still comparable to the NYORP torques. These results can be used to estimate TYORP of different asteroids and also as a basis for more sophisticated models of TYORP.},

abstract = {A thermophysical model is presented that considers surface roughness, cast shadows, multiple or single scattering of radiation, visual and thermal infrared self heating, as well as heat conduction in one or three dimensions. The code is suitable for calculating infrared spectral energy distributions for spatially resolved or unresolved minor Solar System bodies without significant atmospheres or sublimation, such as the Moon, Mercury, asteroids, irregular satellites or inactive regions on comet nuclei. It is here used to explore the effects of surface roughness on spatial scales small enough for heat conduction to erase lateral temperature gradients. Analytically derived corrections to one-dimensional models that reproduce the results of three-dimensional modeling are presented. We find that the temperature of terrains with such small-scale roughness is identical to that of smooth surfaces for certain types of topographies and non-scattering material. However, systematic differences between smooth and rough terrains are found for scattering materials, or topographies with prominent positive relief. Contrary to common beliefs, the roughness on small spatial scales may therefore affect the thermal emission of Solar System bodies.},

abstract = {The small asteroid Itokawa was visited in 2005 by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa. The images of the surface showed a scenario different to previously visited asteroids. Itokawa has a small number of large craters and many large boulders randomly distributed on most of the surface.We analyse images taken at different surface resolution and configurations corresponding to several regions on the asteroid's surface. By overlapping visual images and maps of the total potential and surface gravity, we observe a correlation between the distribution of boulders and these parameters. The boulders on the surface were identified by visual inspection of several images. After fitting ellipses to every boulder, we computed their size and the size distribution from decimeters to several meters at different locations in the surface. We found that the size distribution is correlated with the total potential and the surface gravity. A steeper size distribution shifted towards the small objects is observed in the low negative total potential (high surface gravity), which corresponds to the Muses-C region. Meanwhile, in the "head" and "bottom" regions of high potential (low surface gravity), we obtain a shallower size distribution, shifted towards the large boulders.We confirm there is a size segregation that is correlated with the gravity field which can be explained under the action of the Brazil nut effect. There is a global relocation of boulders, with large ones going into the high potential regions and small ones into the low potential ones. A shape segregation is also observed on the location of the boulders: more rounded ones are found in the regions of high potential, while more elongated ones are frequent in regions of low potential.},

abstract = {Spacecraft observations of atmosphereless Solar System bodies, combined with thermophysical modeling, provide important information about the thermal inertia and degree of surface roughness of these bodies. The thermophysical models rely on various methods of generating topography, the most common being the concave spherical segment. We here compare the properties of thermal emission for a number of different topographies - concave spherical segments, random Gaussians, fractals and parallel sinusoidal trenches - for various illumination and viewing geometries, degrees of surface roughness and wavelengths. We find that the thermal emission is strongly dependent on roughness type, even when the degrees of roughness are identical, for certain illumination and viewing geometries. The systematic usage of any single topography model may therefore bias determinations of thermal inertia and level of roughness. We outline strategies that may be employed during spacecraft observations to disentangle thermal inertia, level of roughness and type of topography. We also compare the numerically complex and time consuming full-scale thermophysical models with a simplified statistical approach, which is fairly easy to implement and quick to run. We conclude that the simplified statistical approach is similar to thermophysical models for cases tested here, which enables the user to analyze huge amounts of spectral data at a low numerical cost.},

abstract = {Asteroid (101955) Bennu, the target of NASA's OSIRIS-REx sample return mission, is a D≈. 0.5. km diameter low albedo near-Earth object. It has a spectral signature consistent with primitive carbonaceous chondrites, and an orbit similar to that of the Earth. A plausible evolution scenario for Bennu is that it migrated inward across the inner main belt from a low albedo family by Yarkovsky thermal forces over many hundreds of Myr. Eventually, it entered a resonance that took it into the terrestrial planet region, where a combination of planetary encounters and resonances took it to its current orbit over a few Myr to tens of Myr. When it departed the main belt, Bennu probably had an eccentricity 0.1. {\textless}. e{\textless}. 0.2 and an inclination 1°. {\textless}. i{\textless}. 6°. Several low albedo families have the appropriate dynamical, color, albedo, and broad spectral characteristics to produce Bennu: Clarissa, Erigone, Eulalia, New Polana, and Sulamitis.Here we used a suite of numerical simulations to determine the ages of the families above, how Bennu reached its current orbit, and the most probable source family for Bennu. Specifically, we tracked test Bennu-like asteroids evolving in semimajor axis by the coupled Yarkovsky/YORP effects, incorporating a new formalism for how YORP torques modify the spin vector evolution of small asteroids. Using results and insights provided by Statler (Statler, T.S. [2009]. Icarus 202, 502-513), we assumed that modest shape changes to asteroids, produced by a variety of processes (e.g., crater formation, changes to asteroid rotational angular momentum by YORP), caused the test asteroids' spin rates, but not their obliquities, to undergo a random walk. This "stochastic YORP" mechanism slows down how often asteroids reach YORP endstates (i.e., spinning up so fast that the asteroid sheds mass, spinning down so much the asteroid enters into a tumbling rotation state). This new model allowed us to reproduce the semimajor axis distribution of observed family members from Clarissa, Erigone, Eulalia, New Polana, and Sulamitis. In the process, we derived model family formation ages of {\~{}}60. Myr old, 130. ±. 30. Myr old, 830-100+370Myr old, 1400. ±. 150. Myr old, and. 200. ±. 40. Myr, respectively.Next, using a Monte-Carlo code to track millions of test asteroids from each of the families above to main belt escape routes capable of producing Bennu-like orbits, we found the most likely parent families for Bennu are Eulalia and New Polana. On average, more than twice as many 0.5. km objects from the New Polana family reach Bennu's orbit as those from the Eulalia family. This corresponds to the New Polana and Eulalia families having a 70-4+8{\%} and 30-8+4{\%} probability of producing Bennu, respectively. Comparable runs to deduce the source of the Hayabusa 2 target, the low albedo 0.87. km diameter near-Earth object (162173) 1999 JU3, produced similar probabilities for both families. The former Marco-Polo-R target, the 1.9. km asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, however, has a 85-83+4{\%} probability of coming from the Eulalia family and a 15-4+83{\%} probability of coming from the New Polana family. The reason for this switch is that 1996 FG3 may have been part of Yarkovsky/YORP-produced wave of like-sized bodies that is only now reaching the terrestrial planet region. We suggest that the top-like shape of Bennu is a byproduct of mass wasting and/or mass shedding events produced by YORP spin up during its long journey across the inner main belt.},

abstract = {The field of asteroid thermophysical modeling has experienced an extraordinary growth in the last 10 years, as new thermal-infrared data became available for hundreds of thousands of asteroids. The infrared emission of asteroids depends on the body's size, shape, albedo, thermal inertia, roughness, and rotational properties. These parameters can therefore be derived by thermophysical modeling of infrared data. Thermophysical modeling led to asteroid size estimates that were confirmed at the few-percent level by later spacecraft visits. We discuss how instrumentation advances now allow mid-infrared interferometric observations as well as high-accuracy spectrophotometry, posing their own set of thermal-modeling challenges. We present major breakthroughs achieved in studies of the thermal inertia, a sensitive indicator for the nature of asteroids soils, allowing us to, e.g., determine the grain size of asteroidal regoliths. Thermal inertia also governs nongravitational effects on asteroid orbits, requiring thermophysical modeling for precise asteroid dynamical studies. The radiative heating of asteroids, meteoroids, and comets from the Sun also governs the thermal stress in surface material; only recently has it been recognized as a significant weathering process. Asteroid space missions with thermal-infrared instruments are currently undergoing study at all major space agencies. This will require a high level of sophistication of thermophysical models in order to analyze high-quality spacecraft data.},

abstract = {The Yarkovsky effect describes a small but significant force that affects the orbital motion of meteoroids and asteroids smaller than 30-40 km in diameter. It is caused by sunlight; when these bodies heat up in the Sun, they eventually reradiate the energy away in the thermal waveband, which in turn creates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and planetary gravitational forces, but it can produce measurable orbital changes over decades and substantial orbital effects over millions to billions of years. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that, complemented by a torque produced by scattered sunlight, can modify the rotation rates and obliquities of small bodies as well. This rotational variant has been coined the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. During the past decade or so, the Yarkovsky and YORP effects have been used to explore and potentially resolve a number of unsolved mysteries in planetary science dealing with small bodies.

In general, the fraction of initial conditions leading to the principal axis rotation is too small, compared to the actual data.

With LSST's large 6.5m diameter primary mirror, a wide 9.6 square degree field of view 3.2 Gigapixel camera, and rapid observational cadence, LSST will discover more than 5 million asteroids over its ten year survey lifetime. With a single visit limiting magnitude of 24.5 in r band, LSST will be able to detect asteroids in the Main Belt down to sub-kilometer sizes. The current strawman for the LSST survey strategy is to obtain two visits (each 'visit' being a pair of back-to-back 15s exposures) per field, separated by about 30 minutes, covering the entire visible sky every 3-4 days throughout the observing season, for ten years. The catalogs generated by LSST will increase the known number of small bodies in the Solar System by a factor of 10-100 times, among all populations. The median number of observations for Main Belt asteroids will be on the order of 200-300, with Near Earth Objects receiving a median of 90 observations. These observations will be spread among ugrizy bandpasses, providing photometric colors and allow sparse lightcurve inversion to determine rotation periods, spin axes, and shape information. These catalogs will be created using automated detection software, the LSST Moving Object Processing System (MOPS), that will take advantage of the carefully characterized LSST optical system, cosmetically clean camera, and recent improvements in difference imaging. Tests with the prototype MOPS software indicate that linking detections (and thus 'discovery') will be possible at LSST depths with our working model for the survey strategy, but evaluation of MOPS and improvements in the survey strategy will continue. All data products and software created by LSST will be publicly available.},

abstract = {The tangential YORP effect (TYORP) plays a significant role in the dynamical evolution of asteroids, and up to now has only been studied numerically. This paper describes the first analytic model of the TYORP effect. Although the model rests on numerous physical and mathematical simplifications, the final analytic expression for TYORP is found to be in agreement with the results of rigorous numeric simulations to the accuracy of several tens per cent. The obtained analytic expression is used to estimate the TYORP produced by the non-flat surface of regolith, -- a contribution to TYORP that has never been considered. It is found that the contribution to TYORP arising from regolith can be comparable to the conventional TYORP produced by boulders. Then, the analytic expression is fitted with a log-normal function and used to integrate TYORP over all boulder sizes. The general trend of TYORP for multiple boulders appears qualitatively similar to the trend of one boulder, and also demonstrates a maximal TYORP at some particular rotation rate. The obtained expression for integrated TYORP may be instrumental for simulations of evolution of asteroids subject to TYORP. To conclude, the physical origin of TYORP is discussed in light of the constructed analytic model.},

Typically, surface roughness exhibits a degeneracy with thermal inertia when thermophysical models are fitted to disc-integrated thermal-infrared observations of asteroids because of this effect. In this work, it is demonstrated how surface roughness can be constrained for near-Earth asteroid (433) Eros (i.e. the target of NASA's NEAR Shoemaker mission) when using the Advanced Thermophysical Model with thermalinfrared observations taken during an 'almost pole-on' illumination and viewing geometry. It is found that the surface roughness of (433) Eros is characterized by an rms slope of 38 ± 8° at the 0.5-cm spatial scale associated with its thermal-infrared beaming effect. This is slightly greater than the rms slope of 25 ± 5° implied by the NEAR Shoemaker laser ranging results when extrapolated to this spatial scale, and indicates that other surface shaping processes might operate, in addition to collisions and gravity, at spatial scales under one metre in order to make asteroid surfaces rougher. For other high-obliquity asteroids observed during 'pole-on' illumination conditions, the thermal-infrared beaming effect allows surface roughness to be constrained when the sub-solar latitude is greater than 60°, and if the asteroids are observed at phase angles of less than 40°. They will likely exhibit near-Earth asteroid thermalmodel beaming parameters that are lower than expected for a typical asteroid at all phase angles up to 100°.},

abstract = {The use of images for spacecraft navigation is well established. Although these images have traditionally been processed by a human analyst on Earth, a variety of recent advancements have led to an increased interest in autonomous imaged-based spacecraft navigation. This work presents a comprehensive treatment of the techniques required to navigate using the lit limb of an ellipsoidal body (usually a planet or moon) in an image. New observations are made regarding the effect of surface albedo and terrain on navigation performance. Furthermore, study of this problem led to a new subpixel edge localization algorithm using Zernike moments, which is found to outperform existing methods for accurately finding the horizon's location in an image. The new limb localization technique is discussed in detail, along with extensive comparisons with alternative approaches. Theoretical results are validated through a variety of numerical examples.},

abstract = {The implication of small amounts of cohesion within relatively small rubble pile asteroids is investigated with regard to their evolution under the persistent presence of the YORP effect. We find that below a characteristic size, which is a function of cohesive strength, density and other properties, rubble pile asteroids can enter a “disaggregation phase” in which they are subject to repeated fissions after which the formation of a stabilizing binary system is not possible. Once this threshold is passed rubble pile asteroids may be disaggregated into their constituent components within a finite time span. These constituent components will have their own spin limits – albeit potentially at a much higher spin rate due to the greater strength of a monolithic body. The implications of this prediction are discussed and include modification of size distributions, prevalence of monolithic bodies among meteoroids and the lifetime of small rubble pile bodies in the solar system. The theory is then used to place constraints on the strength of binary asteroids characterized as a function of their type.},

abstract = {The moniker rubble pile is typically applied to all Solar System bodies {\textgreater}200 m and {\textless}∼10 km in diameter; in this size range, there is an abundance of evidence that nearly every object is bound primarily by self-gravity, with significant void space or bulk porosity between irregularly shaped constituent particles. The understanding of this population is derived from wide-ranging population studies of derived shape and spin, decades of observational studies in numerous wavelengths, evidence left behind from impacts on planets and moons, and the in situ study of a few objects via spacecraft flyby or rendezvous. The internal structure, however, which is responsible for the name rubble pile, is never directly observed but belies a violent history. Many or most of the asteroids on near-Earth orbits and those most accessible for rendezvous and in situ study are likely by-products of the continued collisional evolution of the main asteroid belt.},

abstract = {Autonomous mapping and navigation around unknown small bodies is a challenging problem. In todays missions, small body mapping and navigation (SBMN) require significant human intervention on the ground for map refinement and supervision of the navigation and orbit selection process. Although current methodologies adequately performed in past missions (e.g., Rosetta, Hayabusa, Deep Space), they are not suitable for applications requiring a high level of autonomy. This work proposes a method for autonomous orbit selection and adaptation around a small body while mapping its surface. In particular, in this work, we will develop cost functions that quantify the orbit goodness in the sense of map improvement. In other words, we develop quantitative measures that characterize the accuracy of the small body map and use these measures in an optimization process to compute the next best orbit that maximally contributes to the map enhancement. The proposed framework reduces the human involvement in this process and takes a step toward the fully autonomous mapping and navigation around small bodies.},

abstract = {The OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission is the third mission in National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s New Frontiers Program and is the first U.S. mission to return samples from an asteroid to Earth. The most important decision ahead of the OSIRIS-REx team is the selection of a prime sample-site on the surface of asteroid (101955) Bennu. Mission success hinges on identifying a site that is safe and has regolith that can readily be ingested by the spacecraft's sampling mechanism. To inform this mission-critical decision, the surface of Bennu is mapped using the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite and the images are used to develop several foundational data products. Acquiring the necessary inputs to these data products requires observational strategies that are defined specifically to overcome the challenges associated with mapping a small irregular body. We present these strategies in the context of assessing candidate sample sites at Bennu according to a framework of decisions regarding the relative safety, sampleability, and scientific value across the asteroid's surface. To create data products that aid these assessments, we describe the best practices developed by the OSIRIS-REx team for image-based mapping of irregular small bodies. We emphasize the importance of using 3-D shape models and the ability to work in body-fixed rectangular coordinates when dealing with planetary surfaces that cannot be uniquely addressed by body-fixed latitude and longitude.},

The influence of this effect on the studied asteroid population is rather weak compared to its influence on near-Earth asteroids, which are 3–4 times smaller on average and with {\~{}}3 times more intense solar irradiation; however, it is still sufficiently significant to be identified reliably in the available observational data.},

Here we present early measurements of numerous large candidate impact craters on near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) mission, which indicate a surface that is between 100 million and 1 billion years old, predating Bennu's expected duration as a near-Earth asteroid. We also observe many fractured boulders, the morphology of which suggests an influence of impact or thermal processes over a considerable amount of time since the boulders were exposed at the surface. However, the surface also shows signs of more recent mass movement: clusters of boulders at topographic lows, a deficiency of small craters and infill of large craters. The oldest features likely record events from Bennu's time in the main asteroid belt.},

abstract = {There is a correlation between the components of the YORP effect of most asteroids, which drives the obliquity and spin rate of the affected bodies in a consistent pattern. This allows for a clear and unambiguous picture for how the spin rates and poles of asteroids affected by YORP will evolve and simplifies the overall picture for how populations will migrate on average. The YORP effect can also lead to a previously unexplored equilibrium state for affected bodies. This equilibrium state is a function of the usual "normal YORP" effect (which arises due to the global shape asymmetry of the asteroid) and the "tangential YORP" (which arises due the transport of thermal energy through rocky surface features). Estimates from current shape models show that 10-20$\backslash${\%} of asteroids have the proper condition to be captured in this equilibrium state, indicating that the occurrence of this state may be significant. The existence of this attractor for the asteroid population means that objects affected by YORP may leave their usual YORP cycles and maintain a constant spin rate over long time periods -- this has significant implications for our interpretation of asteroid spin rate evolution and related theories for their physical evolution.},

abstract = {In 2018, the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa2, arrived at the small asteroid Ryugu. The surface of this C-type asteroid is covered with numerous boulders whose size and shape distributions are investigated in this study. Using a few hundred Optical Navigation Camera (ONC) images with a pixel scale of approximately 0.65 m, we focus on boulders greater than 5 m in diameter. Smaller boulders are also considered using five arbitrarily chosen ONC close-up images with pixel scales ranging from 0.7 to 6 cm. Across the entire surface area ({\~{}}2.7 km2) of Ryugu, nearly 4400 boulders larger than 5 m were identified. Boulders appear to be uniformly distributed across the entire surface, with some slight differences in latitude and longitude. At {\~{}}50 km−2, the number density of boulders larger than 20 m is twice as large as on asteroid Itokawa (or Bennu). The apparent shapes of Ryugu's boulders resemble laboratory impact fragments, with larger boulders being more elongated. The ratio of the total volume of boulders larger than 5 m to the total excavated volume of craters larger than 20 m on Ryugu can be estimated to be {\~{}}94{\%}, which is comparatively high. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that most boulders found on Ryugu resulted from the catastrophic disruption of Ryugu's larger parent body, as described in previous papers (Watanabe et al., 2019; Sugita et al., 2019). The cumulative size distribution of boulders larger than 5 m has a power-index of −2.65 ± 0.05, which is comparatively shallow compared with other asteroids visited by spacecraft. For boulders smaller than 4 m, the power-index is even shallower and ranges from −1.65 ± 0.05 to −2.01 ± 0.06. This particularly shallow power-index implies that some boulders are buried in Ryugu's regolith. Based on our observations, we suggest that boulders near the equator might have been buried by the migration of finer material and, as a result, the number density of boulders larger than 5 m in the equatorial region is lower than at higher latitudes.},

Using images and thermal data from NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft, we show that asteroid (101955) Bennu's surface is globally rough, dense with boulders, and low in albedo. The number of boulders is surprising given Bennu's moderate thermal inertia, suggesting that simple models linking thermal inertia to particle size do not adequately capture the complexity relating these properties. At the same time, we find evidence for a wide range of particle sizes with distinct albedo characteristics. Our findings imply that ages of Bennu's surface particles span from the disruption of the asteroid's parent body (boulders) to recent in situ production (micrometre-scale particles).},

abstract = {NASA'S Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft recently arrived at the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, a primitive body that represents the objects that may have brought prebiotic molecules and volatiles such as water to Earth1. Bennu is a low-albedo B-type asteroid2 that has been linked to organic-rich hydrated carbonaceous chondrites3. Such meteorites are altered by ejection from their parent body and contaminated by atmospheric entry and terrestrial microbes. Therefore, the primary mission objective is to return a sample of Bennu to Earth that is pristine—that is, not affected by these processes4. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of instruments to characterize Bennu's global properties, support the selection of a sampling site and document that site at a sub-centimetre scale5–11. Here we consider early OSIRIS-REx observations of Bennu to understand how the asteroid's properties compare to pre-encounter expectations and to assess the prospects for sample return. The bulk composition of Bennu appears to be hydrated and volatile-rich, as expected. However, in contrast to pre-encounter modelling of Bennu's thermal inertia12 and radar polarization ratios13—which indicated a generally smooth surface covered by centimetre-scale particles—resolved imaging reveals an unexpected surficial diversity. The albedo, texture, particle size and roughness are beyond the spacecraft design specifications. On the basis of our pre-encounter knowledge, we developed a sampling strategy to target 50-metre-diameter patches of loose regolith with grain sizes smaller than two centimetres4. We observe only a small number of apparently hazard-free regions, of the order of 5 to 20 metres in extent, the sampling of which poses a substantial challenge to mission success.},

abstract = {Near-Earth Asteroid 99942 Apophis presents a unique opportunity to study the dynamics, bulk properties, and interior structure of a rubble-pile asteroid when it makes its close encounter with the Earth in 2029. In order to better understand the potential outcomes of a tidal encounter between Earth and Apophis, and to support a potential future mission to Apophis, we perform numerical simulations of the encounter. We represent Earth as a single rigid sphere and the target body as a cohesionless, self-gravitating granular aggregate of identical spheres in a hexagonal-close-packed configuration subject only to gravitational and soft-sphere (elastic) contact forces. We use a radar-derived shape model for the asteroid, along with current best estimates for the orbital solution of Apophis to simulate the encounter trajectory, and perform a large parameter sweep over different potential encounter orientations and bulk densities for the body. We find that the median change in the rotational period for Apophis, sampled for a range of different initial body and spin orientations, is −1.9 h (mean −0.1 ± 6.0 (1-$\sigma$) hours) during the encounter. Additionally, we measure that the mean of the largest change in axis length among the 3 primary body axes, also sampled over trials with different initial body and spin orientations, is 0.132 ± 0.066 mm during the encounter, assuming a bulk Young's Modulus of 10 6 Pa. Such strains on the timescale of peak stress during the encounter may be large enough to be detected by an in-situ seismometer.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel Shape from Silhouette (SfS) algorithm to estimate the physical and dynamical properties of a small body-such as an asteroid or comet-from periodic images taken from a distant approaching spacecraft. Standard mapping techniques such as Stereo-Photo-Clinometry (SPC) and Stereo-Photo-Grammetry (SPG) are designed for close-proximity observations in which the body is 1000s of pixels in area, and there are enough surface features on the object. In contrast, our algorithms are suited for distant observations (i.e. during first approach) in which the body is only 10s-100s of pixels in area and does not present any useful visual features. First, using the Fast-Fourier-Transform of the light curve of the small body, we estimate its rotation rate. Then, using our novel silhouette-based 3D shape reconstruction technique, we estimate the shape and size of the small body and its pole of rotation. In this paper, we assume that the small body is performing pure rotation (no tumbling) about its principal axis, that the Sun is directly behind the spacecraft, and that the distance from the spacecraft to the small body is known. These algorithms have been tested using both simulated data from Comet 67P, Asteroids Eros and Itokawa; and real data from the Rosetta mission.},

abstract = {The Hayabusa2 spacecraft arrived at the near-Earth carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu in 2018.We present Hayabusa2 observations of Ryugu's shape, mass, and geomorphology. Ryugu has an oblate "spinning top" shape, with a prominent circular equatorial ridge. Its bulk density, 1.19 ± 0.02 grams per cubic centimeter, indicates a high-porosity ({\textgreater}50{\%}) interior. Large surface boulders suggest a rubble-pile structure. Surface slope analysis shows Ryugu's shape may have been produced from having once spun at twice the current rate. Coupled with the observed global material homogeneity, this suggests that Ryugu was reshaped by centrifugally induced deformation during a period of rapid rotation. From these remote-sensing investigations, we identified a suitable sample collection site on the equatorial ridge.},

abstract = {The top-shaped morphology characteristic of asteroid (101955) Bennu, often found among fast-spinning asteroids and binary asteroid primaries, may have contributed substantially to binary asteroid formation. Yet a detailed geophysical analysis of this morphology for a fast-spinning asteroid has not been possible prior to the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission. Combining the measured Bennu mass and shape obtained during the Preliminary Survey phase of the OSIRIS-REx mission, we find a notable transition in Bennu's surface slopes within its rotational Roche lobe, defined as the region where material is energetically trapped to the surface. As the intersection of the rotational Roche lobe with Bennu's surface has been most recently migrating towards its equator (given Bennu's increasing spin rate), we infer that Bennu's surface slopes have been changing across its surface within the last million years. We also find evidence for substantial density heterogeneity within this body, suggesting that its interior is a mixture of voids and boulders. The presence of such heterogeneity and Bennu's top shape are consistent with spin-induced failure at some point in its past, although the manner of its failure cannot yet be determined. Future measurements by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will provide insight into and may resolve questions regarding the formation and evolution of Bennu's top-shape morphology and its link to the formation of binary asteroids.},

abstract = {During its approach to asteroid (101955) Bennu, NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft surveyed Bennu's immediate environment, photometric properties, and rotation state. Discovery of a dusty environment, a natural satellite, or unexpected asteroid characteristics would have had consequences for the mission's safety and observation strategy. Here we show that spacecraft observations during this period were highly sensitive to satellites (sub-meter scale) but reveal none, although later navigational images indicate that further investigation is needed. We constrain average dust production in September 2018 from Bennu's surface to an upper limit of 150 g s–1 averaged over 34 min. Bennu's disk-integrated photometric phase function validates measurements from the pre-encounter astronomical campaign. We demonstrate that Bennu's rotation rate is accelerating continuously at 3.63 ± 0.52 × 10–6 degrees day–2, likely due to the Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) effect, with evolutionary implications.},

abstract = {Rock breakdown due to diurnal thermal cycling has been hypothesized to drive boulder degradation and regolith production on airless bodies. Numerous studies have invoked its importance in driving landscape evolution, yet morphological features produced by thermal fracture processes have never been definitively observed on an airless body, or any surface where other weathering mechanisms may be ruled out. The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security–Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission provides an opportunity to search for evidence of thermal breakdown and assess its significance on asteroid surfaces. Here we show boulder morphologies observed on Bennu that are consistent with terrestrial observations and models of fatigue-driven exfoliation and demonstrate how crack propagation via thermal stress can lead to their development. The rate and expression of this process will vary with asteroid composition and location, influencing how different bodies evolve and their apparent relative surface ages from space weathering and cratering records.},

abstract = {Any population of asteroids, like asteroid families, will disperse in semi-major axis due to the Yarkovsky effect. The amount of drift is modulated by the asteroid spin state evolution which determines the balance between the diurnal and seasonal Yarkovsky force. The asteroid's spin state is, in turn, controlled in part by the YORP effect. The otherwise smooth evolution of an asteroid can be abruptly altered by collisions, which can cause impulsive changes in the spin state and can move the asteroid onto a different YORP track. In addition, collisions may also alter the YORP parameters by changing the superficial features and overall shape of the asteroid. Thus, the coupling between YORP and Yarkovsky is also strongly affected by the impact history of each body. To investigate this coupling we developed a statistical code modeling the time evolution of semi--major axis under YORP-Yarkovsky coupling. It includes the contributions of NYORP (normal YORP), TYORP (tangential YORP) and collisions whose effects are deterministically calculated and not added in a statistical way. We find that both collisions and TYORP increase the dispersion of a family in semi-major axis by making the spin axis evolution less smooth and regular. We show that the evolution of a family's structure with time is complex and collisions randomize the YORP evolution. In our test families we do not observe the formation of a 'YORP-eye' in the semi-major axis vs. diameter distribution, even after a long period of time. If present, the 'YORP-eye' might be a relic of an initial ejection velocity pattern of the collisional fragments.},

abstract = {Many boulders on (101955) Bennu, a near-Earth rubble pile asteroid, show signs of in situ disaggregation and exfoliation, indicating that thermal fatigue plays an important role in its landscape evolution. Observations of particle ejections from its surface also show it to be an active asteroid, though the driving mechanism of these events is yet to be determined. Exfoliation has been shown to mobilize disaggregated particles in terrestrial environments, suggesting that it may be capable of ejecting material from Bennu's surface. We investigate the nature of thermal fatigue on the asteroid, and the efficacy of fatigue-driven exfoliation as a mechanism for generating asteroid activity, by performing finite element modeling of stress fields induced in boulders from diurnal cycling. We develop a model to predict the spacing of exfoliation fractures and the number and speed of particles that may be ejected during exfoliation events. We find that crack spacing ranges from {\~{}}1 mm to 10 cm and disaggregated particles have ejection speeds up to {\~{}}2 m/s. Exfoliation events are most likely to occur in the late afternoon. These predictions are consistent with observed ejection events at Bennu and indicate that thermal fatigue is a viable mechanism for driving asteroid activity. Crack propagation rates and ejection speeds are greatest at perihelion when the diurnal temperature variation is largest, suggesting that events should be more energetic and more frequent when closer to the Sun. Annual thermal stresses that arise in large boulders may influence the spacing of exfoliation cracks or frequency of ejection events.},

abstract = {Finding the basic mechanism governing the surface history of asteroids of various shapes is essential for understanding their origin and evolution. In particular, the asteroids (162173) Ryugu1 and (101955) Bennu2 currently being visited by Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx appear to be top shaped. This distinctive shape, characterized by a raised equatorial bulge, is shared by other similarly sized asteroids, including Didymos A3, 2008 EV54 and 1999 KW4 Alpha5. However, the possibly common formation mechanism that causes the top-like shape is still under debate. One clue may lie in the boulders on their surfaces. The distribution of these boulders, which was precisely measured in unprecedented detail by the two spacecraft1,2, constitutes a record of the geological evolution of the surface regolith since the origin of these asteroids. Here, we show that during the regolith migration driven by Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack spin-up6–9 the surface boulders coevolve with the underlying regolith and exhibit diverse dynamical behaviours: they can remain undisturbed, sink into the regolith layer and become tilted, or be totally buried by the downslope deposition, depending on their latitudes. The predominant geological features commonly observed on top-shaped asteroids, including the boulder-rich region near the pole1,10, the deficiency of large boulders in the equatorial area10,11 and partially buried, oblique boulders exposed on the regolith surface12,13, are commensurate with this coevolution scenario. The surface regolith migration thus is the prevalent mechanism for the formation history of the top-shaped asteroids with stiffer cores.},

abstract = {The Yarkovsky--O'Keefe--Radzievskii--Paddack (YORP) effect governs the spin evolution of small asteroids. The axial component of YORP, which alters the rotation rate of the asteroid, is mostly independent of its thermal inertia, while the obliquity component is very sensitive to the thermal model of the asteroid. Here we develop a semi-analytic theory for the obliquity component of YORP. We integrate an approximate thermal model over the surface of an asteroid, and find an analytic expression for the obliquity component in terms of two YORP coefficients. This approach allows us to investigate the overall evolution of asteroid rotation state, and to generalize the results previously obtained in the case of zero thermal inertia. The proposed theory also explains how a non-zero obliquity component of YORP originates even for a symmetric asteroid due to its finite thermal inertia. In many cases, this causes equatorial planes of asteroids to align with their orbital planes. The studied non-trivial behavior of YORP as a function of thermal model allows for a new kind of rotational equilibria, which can have important evolutionary consequences for asteroids.},

abstract = {Asteroid 162173 Ryugu is a carbonaceous asteroid that was visited by Japan's Hayabusa2 spacecraft in 2018. The formation mechanism of the “spinning-top” shape of Ryugu is a vital clue to the dynamical history of the near-Earth asteroid. In this study, we address the long-term evolution of its spin state induced by the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect, that is, the thermal recoil torque that changes the rotation period and spin-pole direction. Given the current orbit, spin state, and three-dimensional shape of Ryugu observed by Hayabusa2, we computed the YORP torque exerted on Ryugu using a simplified thermal model assuming zero thermal conductivity. Despite variations in the meter-scaled topography, all 20 shape models that we examined indicate that the spin velocity of Ryugu is currently decreasing at a rate of (Formula presented.) deg/day2. Our findings also suggest that the thermal torque is responsible for maintaining the spin pole upright with respect to the orbital plane. Therefore, the YORP effect may explain the significant spin-down from an earlier period of 3.5 hr to the present period of 7.6 hr. The corresponding time scale of the spin-down is estimated to be 0.58–8.7 million years, depending on the input shape models. This time scale is comparable to the formation period of the largest crater, Urashima (5–12 Ma), or the western bulge (2–9 Ma) as derived from previous studies on crater statistics in Ryugu. Thus, its rotation may have started to decelerate as a consequence of major resurfacing events.},

abstract = {In order to understand the geological evolution of asteroids Eros, Itokawa and Ryugu and their collisional history, previous studies investigated boulder size distributions on their surfaces. However, quantitative comparison of these size distributions is hampered by numerous differences between these studies regarding the definition of a boulder's size, measuring technique and the fitting method to determine the power-index of the boulder size distributions. We provide a consistent and coherent model of boulder size distributions by remeasuring the boulders on the entire surfaces of Eros and Itokawa using the Small Body Mapping Tool (SBMT) and combining our observations with the Ryugu data of Michikami et al. (2019). We derived power-indices of the boulder size distributions of −3.25 ± 0.14 for Eros, −3.05 ± 0.14 for Itokawa and −2.65 ± 0.05 for Ryugu. The asteroid with the highest number density of boulders ≥ 5 m turns out to be Ryugu, not Itokawa, as suggested by an earlier study. We show that the appearance of the boulders tends towards more elongated shapes as the size of an asteroid decreases, which can be explained by differences in asteroid gravity and boulder friction angles. Our quantitative observational results indicate that boulder migration preferentially affects smaller boulders, and tends to occur on larger asteroids.},

Here, we find that the forces measured by the spacecraft are best modeled as a granular bed with near-zero cohesion that is half as dense as the bulk asteroid. The low gravity of a small rubble-pile asteroid such as Bennu effectively weakens its near subsurface by not compressing the upper layers, thereby minimizing the influence of interparticle cohesion on surface geology. The underdensity and weak near subsurface should be global properties of Bennu and not localized to the contact point.},

abstract = {The tangential YORP effect is a radiation pressure torque produced by asymmetric thermal emission by structures on the asteroid surface. As such structures, previous works considered boulders of different shapes lying on the surface of the asteroid. We study the tangential YORP produced by the rough interface of the asteroid's regolith. We create an approximate analytic theory of heat conduction on a slightly non-flat sinusoidal surface. We analyze the published data on the small-scale shape of the asteroid (162173) Ryugu and estimate its tangential YORP due to the surface roughness. We derive an analytic formula that expresses the TYORP of a sinusoidal surface in terms of its geometric and thermal properties. TYORP is maximal at the thermal parameter of the order of unity and for the shape irregularities of the order of the thermal wavelength. Application of this equation to Ryugu predicts TYORP, which is 5-70 times greater than its normal YORP effect. The contribution of the small-scale regolith roughness to the YORP effect of the asteroid can be comparable to the normal YORP and the tangential YORP produced by boulders. The same theory can describe roughness on the asteroid boulders, thus adding a new term to the previously considered TYORP created by boulders.},

abstract = {The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect plays an important role in the rotational properties and evolution of asteroids. While the YORP effect induced by the macroscopic shape of the asteroid and by the presence of surface boulders has been well studied, no investigation has been performed yet regarding how craters with given properties influence this effect. We introduce and estimate the crater-induced YORP effect (CYORP), which arises from the concave structure of the crater, to investigate the magnitude of the resulting torques as a function of varying properties of the crater and the asteroid by a semi-analytical method. The CYORP torque can be comparable to the normal YORP torque when the size of the crater is about one-tenth of the size of the asteroid, or equivalently when the crater/roughness covers one-tenth of the asteroid's surface. Although the torque decreases with the crater size, the combined contribution of all small craters can become non-negligible due to their large number when the commonly used power-law crater size distribution is considered. The CYORP torque of small concave structures, usually considered as surface roughness, is essential to the accurate calculation of the complete YORP torque. Under the CYORP effect that is produced by collisions, asteroids go through a random walk in spin rate and obliquity, with a YORP reset timescale typically of 0.4 Myr. This has strong implications for the rotational evolution and orbital evolution of asteroids. Craters and roughness on asteroid surfaces can influence the YORP torques and therefore the rotational properties and evolution of asteroids. We suggest that the CYORP effect should be considered in the future investigation of the YORP effect on asteroids.},

However, the timescales of such rock fracturing by thermal fatigue are poorly constrained by observations. Here we analyse images of the asteroid (101955) Bennu obtained by the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission and show that metre-scale fractures on the boulders exposed at the surface have a preferential meridional orientation, consistent with cracking induced by diurnal temperature variations. Using an analytical model of fracture propagation, we suggest that fractures the length of those on Bennu's boulders can be produced in 104–105 years. This is a comparable or shorter timescale than mass movement processes that act to expose fresh surfaces and reorient boulders and any preferential direction signature. We propose that boulder surface fracturing happens rapidly compared with the lifetime in near-Earth space of Bennu and other carbonaceous asteroids. The damage due to this space-weathering process has consequences for the material properties of these asteroids, with implications for the preservation of the primordial signature acquired during the accretional phases in the protoplanetary disk of our solar system.},

abstract = {Global geologic maps are useful tools for efficient interpretation of a planetary body, and they provide global context for the diversity and evolution of the surface. We used data acquired by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft to create the first global geologic map of the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu. As this is the first geologic map of a small, non-spherical, rubble-pile asteroid, we discuss the distinctive mapping challenges and best practices that may be useful for future exploration of similar asteroids, such as those to be visited with the Hera and Janus missions. By mapping on two centimeter-scale global image mosaics (2D projected space) and a centimeter-scale global shape model (3D space), we generated three input maps respectively describing Bennu's shape features, geologic features, and surface texture. Based on these input maps, we defined two geologic units: the Smooth Unit and the Rugged Unit. The units are differentiated primarily on the basis of surface texture, concentrations of boulders, and the distributions of lineaments, mass movement features, and craters. They are bounded by several scarps. The Rugged Unit contains abundant boulders and signs of recent mass movement. It also has fewer small ({\textless}20 m), putatively fresh craters than the Smooth Unit, suggesting that such craters have been erased in the former. Based on these geologic indicators, we infer that the Rugged Unit has the younger surface of the two. Differential crater size-frequency distributions and the distribution of the freshest craters suggest that both unit surfaces formed {\~{}}10–65 million years ago, when Bennu was located in the Main Asteroid Belt, and the Smooth Unit has not been significantly resurfaced in the past 2 million years. Meanwhile, the Rugged Unit has experienced resurfacing within the past {\~{}}500,000 years during Bennu's lifetime as a near-Earth asteroid. The geologic units are consistent with global diversity in slope, surface roughness, normal albedo, and thermal emission spectral characteristics. The site on Bennu where the OSIRIS-REx mission collected a regolith sample is located in the Smooth Unit, in a small crater nested within a larger one. So although the Smooth Unit is an older surface than the Rugged Unit, the impact-crater setting indicates that the material sampled was recently exposed. Several similarities are apparent between Bennu and asteroid (162173) Ryugu from a global geologic perspective, including two geologic units distinguishable by variations in the number density of boulders, as well as in other datasets such as brightness.},

abstract = {Evidence is seen for young, fresh surfaces among Near-Earth and Main-Belt asteroids even though space-weathering timescales are shorter than the age of the surfaces. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to refresh asteroid surfaces on short timescales, such as planetary encounters, YORP spinup, thermal degradation, and collisions. Additionally, other factors such as grain size effects have been proposed to explain the existence of these “fresh-looking” spectra. To investigate the role each of these mechanisms may play, we collected a sample of visible and near-infrared spectra of 477 near-Earth and Mars Crosser asteroids with similar sizes and compositions - all with absolute magnitude H{\textgreater}16 and within the S-complex and having olivine to pyroxene (ol/(ol+opx)) ratios {\textgreater}0.65. We taxonomically classify these objects in the Q (fresh) and S (weathered) classes. We find four trends in the Q/S ratio: (1) previous work demonstrated the Q/S ratio increases at smaller sizes down to H{\textless}=16, but we find a sharp increase near H{\~{}}19 after which the ratio decreases monotonically. (2) in agreement with many previous studies, the Q/S ratio increases with decreasing perihelion distance, and we find it is non-zero for larger perihelia 1.2AU, (3) as a new finding our work reveals the Q/S ratio has a sharp, significant peak near {\~{}}5° orbital inclination, and (4) we confirm previous findings that the Q/S ratio is higher for objects that have the possibility of encounter with Earth and Venus versus those that don't, however this finding cannot be distinguished from the perihelion trend. No single resurfacing mechanism can explain all of these trends, so multiple mechanisms are required. YORP spin-up scales with size, thermal degradation is dependent on perihelion, planetary encounters trend with inclination, perihelion and MOID, noting that asteroid-asteroid collisions are also dependent on inclination. It is likely that a combination of all four resurfacing mechanisms are needed to account for all observational trends.},

abstract = {We present a new thermophysical model suitable for simulating the thermal conditions of small celestial bodies, such as asteroids and comet nuclei, as well as local topographic features like rocks, boulders, and craters. The model employs a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach to solve the 3-dimensional heat conduction problem, explicitly accounting for heat conduction between neighboring FEM elements. This sets it apart from other thermophysical models that typically neglect lateral heat conduction. The model takes into account scattering sunlight, self-heating due to thermal radiation, and both horizon and cast shadows. We validated our model against an analytical solution for the transient temperature distribution of a sphere under convective boundary conditions. Additionally, we compared our results with earlier thermophysical modeling works and observational data of asteroid (101955) Bennu. Using the shape models of Bennu as well as scaled versions of (162173) Ryugu, (25143) Itokawa, and (6489) Golevka to match Bennu's surface area, we investigated the effects of shape and lateral heat conduction on the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) torque. Results indicate that contact binary and non-classified/irregular objects experience a stronger YORP torque compared to spheroidal objects. The lateral heat conduction can enhance or dampen the YORP torque. Further analysis is important to obtain more robust statistical conclusions.},

This is an important topic to the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment, where excitation caused by the DART kinetic impact in the Didymos binary asteroid system may be reduced through dissipation before Hera arrives to survey the effects of the impact. We develop a numeric model for energy dissipation in binary asteroids to explore how different system configurations affect the rate of energy dissipation. We find tumbling within the synchronous state eliminates a systematic trend in libration damping on short timescales (several years), but not over long times (hundreds of years) depending on the material conditions. Furthermore, damping of libration, eccentricity, and fluctuations in the semimajor axis are primarily dependent on the stiffness of the secondary, whereas the semimajor axis secular expansion rate is dictated by the stiffness of the primary, as expected. Systems experiencing stable planar libration in the secondary can see a noticeable reduction in libration amplitude after only a few years depending on the stiffness of the secondary, and thus dissipation should be considered during Hera's survey of Didymos. For a very dissipative secondary undergoing stable libration, Hera may be able to calculate the rate of libration damping in Dimorphos and therefore constrain its tidal parameters.},

abstract = {In this work the changing dynamical environment about asteroid (101955) Bennu, one of the most accurately modeled asteroids to date, is analyzed. This is done through the analysis of the evolving equilibrium points and corresponding dynamical ridge lines about this body, as a function of the asteroid's spin rate. This is motivated by the measurement of an accelerating YORP effect on Bennu, causing its spin rate to increase over time with a doubling time on the order of 2 Myr. This study looks at the changes in the dynamical environment about Bennu over times ranging from 1 Myr in the past to 500 kyr in the future. Over this time interval several changes in this environment occur due to pairs of equilibria coming into and out of existence and changing stability properties of these equilibria. As a result of these bifurcations, if Bennu's shape is assumed to be fixed, the number of equilibria increases from a minimum of four (1 Myr in the past), to eight (at the current epoch), to a maximum of 12 (430.6 kyr in the future). After this point, the number of equilibria will decrease as equilibria annihilate with each other. Several equilibria have undergone stability changes and in the future several will cross the surface of the asteroid. Criteria for mathematically detecting all of these transitions were developed and are presented in this work. It is also found that simulated particles initially at rest on the Bennu surface will be lofted when Bennu reaches a rotation period of 3.4304 hr, which will occur within the next 400 kyr. At this point we show that Bennu may appear as an active asteroid.},

abstract = {The OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission is the third mission in National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s New Frontiers Program and is the first U.S. mission to return samples from an asteroid to Earth. The most important decision ahead of the OSIRIS-REx team is the selection of a prime sample-site on the surface of asteroid (101955) Bennu. Mission success hinges on identifying a site that is safe and has regolith that can readily be ingested by the spacecraft's sampling mechanism. To inform this mission-critical decision, the surface of Bennu is mapped using the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite and the images are used to develop several foundational data products. Acquiring the necessary inputs to these data products requires observational strategies that are defined specifically to overcome the challenges associated with mapping a small irregular body. We present these strategies in the context of assessing candidate sample sites at Bennu according to a framework of decisions regarding the relative safety, sampleability, and scientific value across the asteroid's surface. To create data products that aid these assessments, we describe the best practices developed by the OSIRIS-REx team for image-based mapping of irregular small bodies. We emphasize the importance of using 3-D shape models and the ability to work in body-fixed rectangular coordinates when dealing with planetary surfaces that cannot be uniquely addressed by body-fixed latitude and longitude.},

Feature tracking for small bodies brings several challenges, including changing lighting, poor visual texture, and a concentration of features in a small part of an image. Six existing, open-source algorithms for feature tracking were tested on a simulated dataset and compared to the ground truth in the path of features. The main finding is that none of the algorithms provide all of the desired characteristics of long feature tracks with low errors and few outliers. Instead, there is a trade-off between long feature tracks and low error. The feature-matching algorithms SIFT, and BRISK provide good error characteristics, but short feature tracks, whereas the optical flow algorithm KLT provides long feature tracks, but with many features of large error. Given the challenges in feature tracking, it is recommended to focus development on each component of a feature tracking system: detection, description, and outlier rejection.},

The presented algorithm yielded a satisfying estimate of the shape model of interest (point-cloud-to-shape RMS residuals of 0.497 m), along with a consistent range error metric that was trained by means of likelihood maximization over the measured range residuals. The reconstructed shape model of asteroid Itokawa and its associated uncertainty metric were used by an iterated extended Kalman filter for navigation. The filter returned an estimate of the spacecraft state and asteroid attitude that was consistent with the covariance envelopes, despite the defects in the reconstructed shape.},

abstract = {Autonomous mapping and navigation around unknown small bodies is a challenging problem. In todays missions, small body mapping and navigation (SBMN) require significant human intervention on the ground for map refinement and supervision of the navigation and orbit selection process. Although current methodologies adequately performed in past missions (e.g., Rosetta, Hayabusa, Deep Space), they are not suitable for applications requiring a high level of autonomy. This work proposes a method for autonomous orbit selection and adaptation around a small body while mapping its surface. In particular, in this work, we will develop cost functions that quantify the orbit goodness in the sense of map improvement. In other words, we develop quantitative measures that characterize the accuracy of the small body map and use these measures in an optimization process to compute the next best orbit that maximally contributes to the map enhancement. The proposed framework reduces the human involvement in this process and takes a step toward the fully autonomous mapping and navigation around small bodies.},

abstract = {As Earth-based radio tracking navigation is severely limited because of communications constraints and low relative navigation accuracy, autonomous optical navigation capabilities are essential for both robotic and manned deep-space exploration missions. Image processing is considered one of the key technologies for autonomous optical navigation to extract high-precision navigation observables from a raw image. New image processing algorithms for deep-space autonomous optical navigation are developed in this paper. First, multiple image pre-processing and the Canny edge detection algorithm are adopted to identify the edges of target celestial bodies and simultaneously remove the potential false edges. Secondly, two new limb profile fitting algorithms are proposed based on the Least Squares method and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, respectively, with the assumption that the perspective projection of a target celestial body on the image plane will form an ellipse. Next, the line-of-sight (LOS) vector from the spacecraft to the centroid of the observed object is obtained. This is taken as the navigation measurement observable and input to the navigation filter algorithm. Finally, the image processing algorithms developed in this paper are validated using both synthetic simulated images and real flight images from the MESSENGER mission.

abstract = {The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft launched on September 8, 2016 to embark on an asteroid sample return mission. It is expected to rendezvous with the asteroid, Bennu, navigate to the surface, collect a sample (July'20), and return the sample to Earth (September'23). The original mission design called for using one of two Flash Lidar units to provide autonomous navigation to the surface. Following Preliminary design and initial development of the Lidars, reliability issues with the hardware and test program prompted the project to begin development of an alternative navigation technique to be used as a backup to the Lidar. At the critical design review, Natural Feature Tracking (NFT) was added to the mission. NFT is an onboard optical navigation system that compares observed images to a set of asteroid terrain models which are rendered in real-time from a catalog stored in memory on the flight computer. Onboard knowledge of the spacecraft state is then updated by a Kalman filter using the measured residuals between the rendered reference images and the actual observed images. The asteroid terrain models used by NFT are built from a shape model generated from observations collected during earlier phases of the mission and include both terrain shape and albedo information about the asteroid surface. As a result, the success of NFT is dependent on selecting a set of topographic features that can be both identified during descent as well as reliably rendered using the shape model data available. During development, the OSIRIS-REx team faced significant challenges in developing a process conducive to robust operation. This was especially true for terrain models to be used as the spacecraft gets close to the asteroid and higher fidelity models are required for reliable image correlation. This paper will present some of the challenges and lessons learned from the development of the NFT system which includes not just the flight hardware and software but the development of the terrain models used to generate the onboard rendered images.},

This research proposes and models this initial characterization via a series of slow flybys and analyzes how rapidly the gravity field can be estimated and the precision to which it can be determined. Two analytical issues are addressed in this paper that are pertinent to the design of this characterization process and can be used to evaluate whether there is a need for lidar measurements. A new operational procedure called $\Delta$V ranging is proposed, which can eliminate the need for lidar during the initial characterization phase. Following this, the characterization of the gravity field is addressed by performing a covariance analysis around three asteroids: Itokawa, Didymos, and Eros, representing a two-order-of-magnitude difference in size. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Y.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of computing visual hulls from image contours. We propose a new hybrid approach which overcomes the precision-complexity trade-off inherent to voxel based approaches by taking advantage of surface based approaches. To this aim, we introduce a space discretization which does not rely on a regular grid, where most cells are ineffective, but rather on an irregular grid where sample points lie on the surface of the visual hull. Such a grid is composed of tetrahedral cells obtained by applying a Delaunay triangulation on the sample points. These cells are carved afterward according to image silhouette information. The proposed approach keeps the robustness of volumetric approaches while drastically improving their precision and reducing their time and space complexities. It thus allows modeling of objects with complex geometry, and it also makes real time feasible for precise models. Preliminary results with synthetic and real data are presented.},

abstract = {Cast shadows are an informative cue to the shape of objects. They are particularly valuable for discovering object's concavities which are not available from other cues such as occluding boundaries. We propose a new method for recovering shape from shadows which we call shadow carving. Given a conservative estimate of the volume occupied by an object, it is possible to identify and carve away regions of this volume that are inconsistent with the observed pattern of shadows. We prove a theorem that guarantees that when these regions are carved away from the shape, the shape still remains conservative. Shadow carving overcomes limitations of previous studies on shape from shadows because it is robust with respect to errors in shadows detection and it allows the reconstruction of objects in the round, rather than just bas-reliefs. We propose a reconstruction system to recover shape from silhouettes and shadow carving. The silhouettes are used to reconstruct the initial conservative estimate of the object's shape and shadow carving is used to carve out the concavities. We have simulated our reconstruction system with a commercial rendering package to explore the design parameters and assess the accuracy of the reconstruction. We have also implemented our reconstruction scheme in a table-top system and present the results of scanning of several objects. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.},

abstract = {We introduce an algebraic dual-space method for reconstructing the visual hull of a three-dimensional object from occluding contours observed in 2D images. The method exploits the differential structure of the manifold rather than parallax geometry, and therefore requires no correspondences. We begin by observing mat the set of 2D contour tangents determines a surface in a dual space where each point represents a tangent plane to the original surface. The primal and dual surfaces have a symmetric algebra: A point on one is orthogonal to its dual point and tangent basis on the other. Thus the primal surface can be reconstructed if the local dual tangent basis can be estimated. Typically this is impossible because the dual surface is noisy and riddled with tangent singularities due to self-crossings. We identify a directionally-indexed local tangent basis that is well-defined and estimable everywhere on the dual surface. The estimation procedure handles singularities in the dual surface and degeneracies arising from measurement noise. The resulting method has O(N) complexity for N observed contour points and gives asymptotically exact reconstructions of surfaces that are totally observable from occluding contours.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel Shape from Silhouette (SfS) algorithm to estimate the physical and dynamical properties of a small body-such as an asteroid or comet-from periodic images taken from a distant approaching spacecraft. Standard mapping techniques such as Stereo-Photo-Clinometry (SPC) and Stereo-Photo-Grammetry (SPG) are designed for close-proximity observations in which the body is 1000s of pixels in area, and there are enough surface features on the object. In contrast, our algorithms are suited for distant observations (i.e. during first approach) in which the body is only 10s-100s of pixels in area and does not present any useful visual features. First, using the Fast-Fourier-Transform of the light curve of the small body, we estimate its rotation rate. Then, using our novel silhouette-based 3D shape reconstruction technique, we estimate the shape and size of the small body and its pole of rotation. In this paper, we assume that the small body is performing pure rotation (no tumbling) about its principal axis, that the Sun is directly behind the spacecraft, and that the distance from the spacecraft to the small body is known. These algorithms have been tested using both simulated data from Comet 67P, Asteroids Eros and Itokawa; and real data from the Rosetta mission.},

Although these images have traditionally been processed by a human analyst on Earth, a variety of recent advancements have led to an increased interest in autonomous imaged-based spacecraft navigation. This work presents a comprehensive treatment of the techniques required to navigate using the lit limb of an ellipsoidal body (usually a planet or moon) in an image. New observations are made regarding the effect of surface albedo and terrain on navigation performance. Furthermore, study of this problem led to a new subpixel edge localization algorithm using Zernike moments, which is found to outperform existing methods for accurately finding the horizon's location in an image. The new limb localization technique is discussed in detail, along with extensive comparisons with alternative approaches. Theoretical results are validated through a variety of numerical examples.},

abstract = {Improved measurement techniques allow quantitative testing of the physical significance of the shapes of small satellites such as the possible occurrence of equilibrium ellipsoid forms. Shapes of the small satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus have been measured using limb coordinates from spacecraft images. Limb-derived ellipsoidal models can measure volumes of irregular objects accurately: ellipsoidal models of Phobos and Deimos derived from limb coordinates are nearly identical to those obtained independently from stereogrammetry (Duxbury and Callahan 1988). These ellipsoidal approximations, however, are incomplete descriptions of the shapes of small satellites in that average residuals are much larger than measurement errors. Ellipsoidal models of eight small satellites compared with equilibrium ellipsoids show that shapes of even moderately irregular satellites are poor predictors of mean densities. Icy satellites smaller than mean radius (Rm) ≈ 150 km are irregularly shaped and have limb roughnesses of several percent of mean radius (RMS residuals .03-.08 Rm). There is no trend in roughness with size below Rm = 150 km. Larger icy satellites are ellipsoidal and have limb roughness below 0.01 Rm. "Rocky" satellites of Rm = 6-110 km are also irregularly shaped; the only larger rocky satellites are the Moon and Io (Rm = 1740 and 1820 km) which have roughnesses well below 0.01 Rm. Data on rocky satellites combined with published data for Ceres and Juno (Millis et al. 1981, 1987) suggest a gradual transition from irregular to ellipsoidal rocky objects. Limb topography and images suggest that the small satellites retain impact scars of diameter of up to 1.7 times the satellite mean radius. These large indentations are the primary difference in shape between small and large satellites. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the characterization of small body surfaces with stereophotoclinometry are {\&} discussed. The principal data output is an ensemble of landmark maps (L-maps), high-resolution topography/albedo maps of varying resolution that tile the surface of the body. Because they can have a resolution comparable to the best images, and can be located on a global reference frame to high accuracy, L-maps provide a significant improvement in discriminatory power for studies of small bodies, ranging from regolith processes to interior structure. These techniques are now being used to map larger bodies such as the Moon and Mercury. L-maps are combined to produce a standard global topography model (GTM) with about 1.57 million vectors and having a wide variety of applications. They can also be combined to produce high-resolution topography maps that describe local areas with much greater detail than the GTM. When combined with nominal predictions from other data sources and available data from other instruments such as LIDAR or RADAR, solutions for the spacecraft position and camera pointing are the most accurate available. Examples are drawn from studies of Phobos, Eros, and Itokawa, including surface characterization, gravity analysis, spacecraft navigation, and incorporation of LIDAR or RADAR data.

abstract = {An integrated profram for spacecraft navigation and determination of small body dynamics, shape, and high-resolution topography is discussed. Multiple image stereography and photoclinometry (shape from shading) are used to construct high resolution topographic and albedo maps, whose centers are treated as control points. These landmark maps are re-illuminated and correlated with images to act as body-fixed navigation tie-points. Their limb projections are compared with observed limb profiles to better fix their locations and the spacecraft pointing and positionn. Maps are also correlated with overlapping maps to better determine their body-fixed locations. Finally, a set of overlapping maps covering the body's surface is used to construct a high-resolution model for the body's shape and topography. Assuming a homogeneous mass distribution, such a model can be used to determine gravity harmonics for orbit prediction. These procedures are applicable to any mission involving an extended orbital phase, such as NEAR, Dawn, Deep Interior, or MESSENGER. Eventually, landmark maps could be uploaded to the spacecraft to allow for autonomous optical navigation. As a proof of concept for the Dawn mission, a small sample ({\textless}2000 images) of the available data from the NEAR mission has been used to construct a shape and topography model for Eros. The model is less noisy than the laser altimetry result and, for a homogenous mass distribution, it correlates better with observed gravity harmonics.},

abstract = {The Ball-Pivoting Algorithm (BPA) computes a triangle mesh interpolating a given point cloud. Typically, the points are surface samples acquired with multiple range scans of an object, The principle of (he BPA is very simple: Three points form a triangle if a ball of a user-specified radius p touches them without containing any other point. Starting with a seed triangle, the ball pivots around an edge (i.e., it revolves around the edge while keeping in contact with the edge's endpoints) until it touches another point, forming another triangle, The process continues until all reachable edges have been tried, and then starts from another seed triangle, until all points have been considered. The process can then be repeated with a ball of larger radius to handle uneven sampling densities. We applied the BPA to datasets of millions of points representing actual scans of complex 3D objects. The relatively small amount of memory required by the BPA, its time efficiency, and the quality of the results obtained compare favorably with existing techniques. {\textcopyright} 1999 IEEE.},

abstract = {a previous paper these authors presented a new mesh-growing approach based on the Gabriel 2 – Simplex (G2S) criterion. If compared with the Cocone family and the Ball Pivoting methods, G2S demonstrated to be competitive in terms of tessellation rate, quality of the generated triangles and defectiveness produced when the surface to be reconstructed was locally flat. Nonetheless, its major limitation was that, in the presence of a mesh which was locally non – flat or which was not sufficiently sampled, the method was less robust and holes and non – manifold vertices were generated. In order to overcome these limitations, in this paper, the performance of the G2S mesh-growing method is fully improved in terms of robustness. Method: For this purpose, an original priority queue for the driving of the front growth and a post processing to efficiently erase the non–manifold vertices are proposed. Result: The performance of the new version of the G2S approach has been compared with that of the old one, and that of the Cocone family and the Ball Pivoting methods in the tessellation of some benchmark point clouds and artificially noised test cases. The results derived from these experiments show that the improvements being proposed and implemented prevent the generation of non–manifold vertices and render the new version more robust than the old one. This performance improvement is achieved by a small reduction of the tessellation rate as opposed to the old version; the rate is still, however, at least an order of magnitude higher than the other methods here considered (the Cocone family and the Ball Pivoting methods). Discussion {\&} Conclusion: The results obtained show that the use of the new version of G2S is advantageous, as opposed to the other methods here considered, even in the case of noised point clouds. In fact, since it does not perform the smoothing of points, not even in the presence of very noised meshes, the new version of G2S, while producing more holes than the Robust Cocone and the Ball Pivoting, nonetheless manages to preserve the manifoldness and important details of the object.},

abstract = {NASA'S Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft recently arrived at the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, a primitive body that represents the objects that may have brought prebiotic molecules and volatiles such as water to Earth1. Bennu is a low-albedo B-type asteroid2 that has been linked to organic-rich hydrated carbonaceous chondrites3. Such meteorites are altered by ejection from their parent body and contaminated by atmospheric entry and terrestrial microbes. Therefore, the primary mission objective is to return a sample of Bennu to Earth that is pristine—that is, not affected by these processes4. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of instruments to characterize Bennu's global properties, support the selection of a sampling site and document that site at a sub-centimetre scale5–11. Here we consider early OSIRIS-REx observations of Bennu to understand how the asteroid's properties compare to pre-encounter expectations and to assess the prospects for sample return. The bulk composition of Bennu appears to be hydrated and volatile-rich, as expected. However, in contrast to pre-encounter modelling of Bennu's thermal inertia12 and radar polarization ratios13—which indicated a generally smooth surface covered by centimetre-scale particles—resolved imaging reveals an unexpected surficial diversity. The albedo, texture, particle size and roughness are beyond the spacecraft design specifications. On the basis of our pre-encounter knowledge, we developed a sampling strategy to target 50-metre-diameter patches of loose regolith with grain sizes smaller than two centimetres4. We observe only a small number of apparently hazard-free regions, of the order of 5 to 20 metres in extent, the sampling of which poses a substantial challenge to mission success.},

abstract = {The requirements-driven OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite (OCAMS) acquires images essential to collecting a sample from the surface of Bennu. During proximity operations, these images document the presence of satellites and plumes, record spin state, enable an accurate digital terrain model of the asteroid's shape, and identify any surface hazards. They confirm the presence of sampleable regolith on the surface, observe the sampling event itself, and image the sample head in order to verify its readiness to be stowed. They document Bennu's history as an example of early solar system material, as a microgravity body with a planetesimal size-scale, and as a carbonaceous object. OCAMS is fitted with three cameras. The MapCam records point-source color images on approach to the asteroid in order to connect Bennu's ground-based point-source observational record to later higher-resolution surface spectral imaging. The SamCam documents the sample site before, during, and after it is disturbed by the sample mechanism. The PolyCam, using its focus mechanism, observes the sample site at sub-centimeter resolutions, revealing surface texture and morphology. While their imaging requirements divide naturally between the three cameras, they preserve a strong degree of functional overlap. OCAMS and the other spacecraft instruments allow the OSIRIS-REx mission to collect a sample from a microgravity body on the same visit during which it was first optically acquired from long range, a useful capability as humanity explores near-Earth, Main-Belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids.},

@article{Lowe2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

@article{Boyer2003,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of computing visual hulls from image contours. We propose a new hybrid approach which overcomes the precision-complexity trade-off inherent to voxel based approaches by taking advantage of surface based approaches. To this aim, we introduce a space discretization which does not rely on a regular grid, where most cells are ineffective, but rather on an irregular grid where sample points lie on the surface of the visual hull. Such a grid is composed of tetrahedral cells obtained by applying a Delaunay triangulation on the sample points. These cells are carved afterward according to image silhouette information. The proposed approach keeps the robustness of volumetric approaches while drastically improving their precision and reducing their time and space complexities. It thus allows modeling of objects with complex geometry, and it also makes real time feasible for precise models. Preliminary results with synthetic and real data are presented.},

In this work, we present an automatic estimation method for the shape and motion of an asteroid, which is planned to be tested in future exploration missions including Japanese Hayabusa-2 [1]. Our task is to estimate the shape and rotation axis of the asteroid, as well as positions of the spacecraft from optical images. The proposed method is based on the expectation conditional-maximization (ECM) framework that consists of an auxiliary particle filter and nonlinear optimization techniques. One of our technical contributions is the estimation of the direction of rotation axis of the asteroid from monocular camera images, which are taken by the moving spacecraft. We conducted two experiments with synthetic data and an asteroid mock-up to show the validity of the proposed method and to present the numerical accuracy.},
