abstract = {The OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission is the third mission in National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s New Frontiers Program and is the first U.S. mission to return samples from an asteroid to Earth. The most important decision ahead of the OSIRIS-REx team is the selection of a prime sample-site on the surface of asteroid (101955) Bennu. Mission success hinges on identifying a site that is safe and has regolith that can readily be ingested by the spacecraft's sampling mechanism. To inform this mission-critical decision, the surface of Bennu is mapped using the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite and the images are used to develop several foundational data products. Acquiring the necessary inputs to these data products requires observational strategies that are defined specifically to overcome the challenges associated with mapping a small irregular body. We present these strategies in the context of assessing candidate sample sites at Bennu according to a framework of decisions regarding the relative safety, sampleability, and scientific value across the asteroid's surface. To create data products that aid these assessments, we describe the best practices developed by the OSIRIS-REx team for image-based mapping of irregular small bodies. We emphasize the importance of using 3-D shape models and the ability to work in body-fixed rectangular coordinates when dealing with planetary surfaces that cannot be uniquely addressed by body-fixed latitude and longitude.},

abstract = {The autonomous approach of a spacecraft to an asteroid or comet (a small body) relies heavily on visual fea- ture tracking to aid in estimating relative trajectories and the properties of the small body. Feature tracking for small bodies brings several challenges, including changing lighting, poor visual texture, and a concentration of features in a small part of an image. Six existing, open-source algorithms for feature tracking were tested on a simulated dataset and compared to the ground truth in the path of features. The main finding is that none of the algorithms provide all of the desired characteristics of long feature tracks with low errors and few outliers. Instead, there is a trade-off between long feature tracks and low error. The feature-matching algorithms SIFT, and BRISK provide good error characteristics, but short feature tracks, whereas the optical flow algorithm KLT provides long feature tracks, but with many features of large error. Given the challenges in feature tracking, it is recommended to focus development on each component of a feature tracking system: detection, description, and outlier rejection.},

The presented algorithm yielded a satisfying estimate of the shape model of interest (point-cloud-to-shape RMS residuals of 0.497 m), along with a consistent range error metric that was trained by means of likelihood maximization over the measured range residuals. The reconstructed shape model of asteroid Itokawa and its associated uncertainty metric were used by an iterated extended Kalman filter for navigation. The filter returned an estimate of the spacecraft state and asteroid attitude that was consistent with the covariance envelopes, despite the defects in the reconstructed shape.},

abstract = {Autonomous mapping and navigation around unknown small bodies is a challenging problem. In todays missions, small body mapping and navigation (SBMN) require significant human intervention on the ground for map refinement and supervision of the navigation and orbit selection process. Although current methodologies adequately performed in past missions (e.g., Rosetta, Hayabusa, Deep Space), they are not suitable for applications requiring a high level of autonomy. This work proposes a method for autonomous orbit selection and adaptation around a small body while mapping its surface. In particular, in this work, we will develop cost functions that quantify the orbit goodness in the sense of map improvement. In other words, we develop quantitative measures that characterize the accuracy of the small body map and use these measures in an optimization process to compute the next best orbit that maximally contributes to the map enhancement. The proposed framework reduces the human involvement in this process and takes a step toward the fully autonomous mapping and navigation around small bodies.},

abstract = {As Earth-based radio tracking navigation is severely limited because of communications constraints and low relative navigation accuracy, autonomous optical navigation capabilities are essential for both robotic and manned deep-space exploration missions. Image processing is considered one of the key technologies for autonomous optical navigation to extract high-precision navigation observables from a raw image. New image processing algorithms for deep-space autonomous optical navigation are developed in this paper. First, multiple image pre-processing and the Canny edge detection algorithm are adopted to identify the edges of target celestial bodies and simultaneously remove the potential false edges. Secondly, two new limb profile fitting algorithms are proposed based on the Least Squares method and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, respectively, with the assumption that the perspective projection of a target celestial body on the image plane will form an ellipse. Next, the line-of-sight (LOS) vector from the spacecraft to the centroid of the observed object is obtained. This is taken as the navigation measurement observable and input to the navigation filter algorithm. Finally, the image processing algorithms developed in this paper are validated using both synthetic simulated images and real flight images from the MESSENGER mission.

abstract = {The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft launched on September 8, 2016 to embark on an asteroid sample return mission. It is expected to rendezvous with the asteroid, Bennu, navigate to the surface, collect a sample (July'20), and return the sample to Earth (September'23). The original mission design called for using one of two Flash Lidar units to provide autonomous navigation to the surface. Following Preliminary design and initial development of the Lidars, reliability issues with the hardware and test program prompted the project to begin development of an alternative navigation technique to be used as a backup to the Lidar. At the critical design review, Natural Feature Tracking (NFT) was added to the mission. NFT is an onboard optical navigation system that compares observed images to a set of asteroid terrain models which are rendered in real-time from a catalog stored in memory on the flight computer. Onboard knowledge of the spacecraft state is then updated by a Kalman filter using the measured residuals between the rendered reference images and the actual observed images. The asteroid terrain models used by NFT are built from a shape model generated from observations collected during earlier phases of the mission and include both terrain shape and albedo information about the asteroid surface. As a result, the success of NFT is dependent on selecting a set of topographic features that can be both identified during descent as well as reliably rendered using the shape model data available. During development, the OSIRIS-REx team faced significant challenges in developing a process conducive to robust operation. This was especially true for terrain models to be used as the spacecraft gets close to the asteroid and higher fidelity models are required for reliable image correlation. This paper will present some of the challenges and lessons learned from the development of the NFT system which includes not just the flight hardware and software but the development of the terrain models used to generate the onboard rendered images.},

This research proposes and models this initial characterization via a series of slow flybys and analyzes how rapidly the gravity field can be estimated and the precision to which it can be determined. Two analytical issues are addressed in this paper that are pertinent to the design of this characterization process and can be used to evaluate whether there is a need for lidar measurements. A new operational procedure called $\Delta$V ranging is proposed, which can eliminate the need for lidar during the initial characterization phase. Following this, the characterization of the gravity field is addressed by performing a covariance analysis around three asteroids: Itokawa, Didymos, and Eros, representing a two-order-of-magnitude difference in size. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Y.

We propose a new hybrid approach which overcomes the precision-complexity trade-off inherent to voxel based approaches by taking advantage of surface based approaches. To this aim, we introduce a space discretization which does not rely on a regular grid, where most cells are ineffective, but rather on an irregular grid where sample points lie on the surface of the visual hull. Such a grid is composed of tetrahedral cells obtained by applying a Delaunay triangulation on the sample points. These cells are carved afterward according to image silhouette information. The proposed approach keeps the robustness of volumetric approaches while drastically improving their precision and reducing their time and space complexities. It thus allows modeling of objects with complex geometry, and it also makes real time feasible for precise models. Preliminary results with synthetic and real data are presented.},

abstract = {Cast shadows are an informative cue to the shape of objects. They are particularly valuable for discovering object's concavities which are not available from other cues such as occluding boundaries. We propose a new method for recovering shape from shadows which we call shadow carving. Given a conservative estimate of the volume occupied by an object, it is possible to identify and carve away regions of this volume that are inconsistent with the observed pattern of shadows. We prove a theorem that guarantees that when these regions are carved away from the shape, the shape still remains conservative. Shadow carving overcomes limitations of previous studies on shape from shadows because it is robust with respect to errors in shadows detection and it allows the reconstruction of objects in the round, rather than just bas-reliefs. We propose a reconstruction system to recover shape from silhouettes and shadow carving. The silhouettes are used to reconstruct the initial conservative estimate of the object's shape and shadow carving is used to carve out the concavities. We have simulated our reconstruction system with a commercial rendering package to explore the design parameters and assess the accuracy of the reconstruction. We have also implemented our reconstruction scheme in a table-top system and present the results of scanning of several objects. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.},

@article{Brand2004,
abstract = {We introduce an algebraic dual-space method for reconstructing the visual hull of a three-dimensional object from occluding contours observed in 2D images. The method exploits the differential structure of the manifold rather than parallax geometry, and therefore requires no correspondences. We begin by observing mat the set of 2D contour tangents determines a surface in a dual space where each point represents a tangent plane to the original surface. The primal and dual surfaces have a symmetric algebra: A point on one is orthogonal to its dual point and tangent basis on the other. Thus the primal surface can be reconstructed if the local dual tangent basis can be estimated. Typically this is impossible because the dual surface is noisy and riddled with tangent singularities due to self-crossings. We identify a directionally-indexed local tangent basis that is well-defined and estimable everywhere on the dual surface. The estimation procedure handles singularities in the dual surface and degeneracies arising from measurement noise. The resulting method has O(N) complexity for N observed contour points and gives asymptotically exact reconstructions of surfaces that are totally observable from occluding contours.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel Shape from Silhouette (SfS) algorithm to estimate the physical and dynamical properties of a small body-such as an asteroid or comet-from periodic images taken from a distant approaching spacecraft. Standard mapping techniques such as Stereo-Photo-Clinometry (SPC) and Stereo-Photo-Grammetry (SPG) are designed for close-proximity observations in which the body is 1000s of pixels in area, and there are enough surface features on the object. In contrast, our algorithms are suited for distant observations (i.e. during first approach) in which the body is only 10s-100s of pixels in area and does not present any useful visual features. First, using the Fast-Fourier-Transform of the light curve of the small body, we estimate its rotation rate. Then, using our novel silhouette-based 3D shape reconstruction technique, we estimate the shape and size of the small body and its pole of rotation. In this paper, we assume that the small body is performing pure rotation (no tumbling) about its principal axis, that the Sun is directly behind the spacecraft, and that the distance from the spacecraft to the small body is known. These algorithms have been tested using both simulated data from Comet 67P, Asteroids Eros and Itokawa; and real data from the Rosetta mission.},

Although these images have traditionally been processed by a human analyst on Earth, a variety of recent advancements have led to an increased interest in autonomous imaged-based spacecraft navigation. This work presents a comprehensive treatment of the techniques required to navigate using the lit limb of an ellipsoidal body (usually a planet or moon) in an image. New observations are made regarding the effect of surface albedo and terrain on navigation performance. Furthermore, study of this problem led to a new subpixel edge localization algorithm using Zernike moments, which is found to outperform existing methods for accurately finding the horizon's location in an image. The new limb localization technique is discussed in detail, along with extensive comparisons with alternative approaches. Theoretical results are validated through a variety of numerical examples.},

abstract = {Improved measurement techniques allow quantitative testing of the physical significance of the shapes of small satellites such as the possible occurrence of equilibrium ellipsoid forms. Shapes of the small satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus have been measured using limb coordinates from spacecraft images. Limb-derived ellipsoidal models can measure volumes of irregular objects accurately: ellipsoidal models of Phobos and Deimos derived from limb coordinates are nearly identical to those obtained independently from stereogrammetry (Duxbury and Callahan 1988). These ellipsoidal approximations, however, are incomplete descriptions of the shapes of small satellites in that average residuals are much larger than measurement errors. Ellipsoidal models of eight small satellites compared with equilibrium ellipsoids show that shapes of even moderately irregular satellites are poor predictors of mean densities. Icy satellites smaller than mean radius (Rm) ≈ 150 km are irregularly shaped and have limb roughnesses of several percent of mean radius (RMS residuals .03-.08 Rm). There is no trend in roughness with size below Rm = 150 km. Larger icy satellites are ellipsoidal and have limb roughness below 0.01 Rm. "Rocky" satellites of Rm = 6-110 km are also irregularly shaped; the only larger rocky satellites are the Moon and Io (Rm = 1740 and 1820 km) which have roughnesses well below 0.01 Rm. Data on rocky satellites combined with published data for Ceres and Juno (Millis et al. 1981, 1987) suggest a gradual transition from irregular to ellipsoidal rocky objects. Limb topography and images suggest that the small satellites retain impact scars of diameter of up to 1.7 times the satellite mean radius. These large indentations are the primary difference in shape between small and large satellites. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the characterization of small body surfaces with stereophotoclinometry are {\&} discussed. The principal data output is an ensemble of landmark maps (L-maps), high-resolution topography/albedo maps of varying resolution that tile the surface of the body. Because they can have a resolution comparable to the best images, and can be located on a global reference frame to high accuracy, L-maps provide a significant improvement in discriminatory power for studies of small bodies, ranging from regolith processes to interior structure. These techniques are now being used to map larger bodies such as the Moon and Mercury. L-maps are combined to produce a standard global topography model (GTM) with about 1.57 million vectors and having a wide variety of applications. They can also be combined to produce high-resolution topography maps that describe local areas with much greater detail than the GTM. When combined with nominal predictions from other data sources and available data from other instruments such as LIDAR or RADAR, solutions for the spacecraft position and camera pointing are the most accurate available. Examples are drawn from studies of Phobos, Eros, and Itokawa, including surface characterization, gravity analysis, spacecraft navigation, and incorporation of LIDAR or RADAR data.

abstract = {An integrated profram for spacecraft navigation and determination of small body dynamics, shape, and high-resolution topography is discussed. Multiple image stereography and photoclinometry (shape from shading) are used to construct high resolution topographic and albedo maps, whose centers are treated as control points. These landmark maps are re-illuminated and correlated with images to act as body-fixed navigation tie-points. Their limb projections are compared with observed limb profiles to better fix their locations and the spacecraft pointing and positionn. Maps are also correlated with overlapping maps to better determine their body-fixed locations. Finally, a set of overlapping maps covering the body's surface is used to construct a high-resolution model for the body's shape and topography. Assuming a homogeneous mass distribution, such a model can be used to determine gravity harmonics for orbit prediction. These procedures are applicable to any mission involving an extended orbital phase, such as NEAR, Dawn, Deep Interior, or MESSENGER. Eventually, landmark maps could be uploaded to the spacecraft to allow for autonomous optical navigation. As a proof of concept for the Dawn mission, a small sample ({\textless}2000 images) of the available data from the NEAR mission has been used to construct a shape and topography model for Eros. The model is less noisy than the laser altimetry result and, for a homogenous mass distribution, it correlates better with observed gravity harmonics.},

Starting with a seed triangle, the ball pivots around an edge (i.e., it revolves around the edge while keeping in contact with the edge's endpoints) until it touches another point, forming another triangle, The process continues until all reachable edges have been tried, and then starts from another seed triangle, until all points have been considered. The process can then be repeated with a ball of larger radius to handle uneven sampling densities. We applied the BPA to datasets of millions of points representing actual scans of complex 3D objects. The relatively small amount of memory required by the BPA, its time efficiency, and the quality of the results obtained compare favorably with existing techniques. {\textcopyright} 1999 IEEE.},

abstract = {a previous paper these authors presented a new mesh-growing approach based on the Gabriel 2 – Simplex (G2S) criterion. If compared with the Cocone family and the Ball Pivoting methods, G2S demonstrated to be competitive in terms of tessellation rate, quality of the generated triangles and defectiveness produced when the surface to be reconstructed was locally flat. Nonetheless, its major limitation was that, in the presence of a mesh which was locally non – flat or which was not sufficiently sampled, the method was less robust and holes and non – manifold vertices were generated. In order to overcome these limitations, in this paper, the performance of the G2S mesh-growing method is fully improved in terms of robustness. Method: For this purpose, an original priority queue for the driving of the front growth and a post processing to efficiently erase the non–manifold vertices are proposed. Result: The performance of the new version of the G2S approach has been compared with that of the old one, and that of the Cocone family and the Ball Pivoting methods in the tessellation of some benchmark point clouds and artificially noised test cases. The results derived from these experiments show that the improvements being proposed and implemented prevent the generation of non–manifold vertices and render the new version more robust than the old one. This performance improvement is achieved by a small reduction of the tessellation rate as opposed to the old version; the rate is still, however, at least an order of magnitude higher than the other methods here considered (the Cocone family and the Ball Pivoting methods). Discussion {\&} Conclusion: The results obtained show that the use of the new version of G2S is advantageous, as opposed to the other methods here considered, even in the case of noised point clouds. In fact, since it does not perform the smoothing of points, not even in the presence of very noised meshes, the new version of G2S, while producing more holes than the Robust Cocone and the Ball Pivoting, nonetheless manages to preserve the manifoldness and important details of the object.},

abstract = {NASA'S Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft recently arrived at the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, a primitive body that represents the objects that may have brought prebiotic molecules and volatiles such as water to Earth1. Bennu is a low-albedo B-type asteroid2 that has been linked to organic-rich hydrated carbonaceous chondrites3. Such meteorites are altered by ejection from their parent body and contaminated by atmospheric entry and terrestrial microbes. Therefore, the primary mission objective is to return a sample of Bennu to Earth that is pristine—that is, not affected by these processes4. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of instruments to characterize Bennu's global properties, support the selection of a sampling site and document that site at a sub-centimetre scale5–11. Here we consider early OSIRIS-REx observations of Bennu to understand how the asteroid's properties compare to pre-encounter expectations and to assess the prospects for sample return. The bulk composition of Bennu appears to be hydrated and volatile-rich, as expected. However, in contrast to pre-encounter modelling of Bennu's thermal inertia12 and radar polarization ratios13—which indicated a generally smooth surface covered by centimetre-scale particles—resolved imaging reveals an unexpected surficial diversity. The albedo, texture, particle size and roughness are beyond the spacecraft design specifications. On the basis of our pre-encounter knowledge, we developed a sampling strategy to target 50-metre-diameter patches of loose regolith with grain sizes smaller than two centimetres4. We observe only a small number of apparently hazard-free regions, of the order of 5 to 20 metres in extent, the sampling of which poses a substantial challenge to mission success.},

@article{Rizk2017,
abstract = {The requirements-driven OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite (OCAMS) acquires images essential to collecting a sample from the surface of Bennu. During proximity operations, these images document the presence of satellites and plumes, record spin state, enable an accurate digital terrain model of the asteroid's shape, and identify any surface hazards. They confirm the presence of sampleable regolith on the surface, observe the sampling event itself, and image the sample head in order to verify its readiness to be stowed. They document Bennu's history as an example of early solar system material, as a microgravity body with a planetesimal size-scale, and as a carbonaceous object. OCAMS is fitted with three cameras. The MapCam records point-source color images on approach to the asteroid in order to connect Bennu's ground-based point-source observational record to later higher-resolution surface spectral imaging. The SamCam documents the sample site before, during, and after it is disturbed by the sample mechanism. The PolyCam, using its focus mechanism, observes the sample site at sub-centimeter resolutions, revealing surface texture and morphology. While their imaging requirements divide naturally between the three cameras, they preserve a strong degree of functional overlap. OCAMS and the other spacecraft instruments allow the OSIRIS-REx mission to collect a sample from a microgravity body on the same visit during which it was first optically acquired from long range, a useful capability as humanity explores near-Earth, Main-Belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids.},

@article{Lowe2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

@article{Boyer2003,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of computing visual hulls from image contours. We propose a new hybrid approach which overcomes the precision-complexity trade-off inherent to voxel based approaches by taking advantage of surface based approaches. To this aim, we introduce a space discretization which does not rely on a regular grid, where most cells are ineffective, but rather on an irregular grid where sample points lie on the surface of the visual hull. Such a grid is composed of tetrahedral cells obtained by applying a Delaunay triangulation on the sample points. These cells are carved afterward according to image silhouette information. The proposed approach keeps the robustness of volumetric approaches while drastically improving their precision and reducing their time and space complexities. It thus allows modeling of objects with complex geometry, and it also makes real time feasible for precise models. Preliminary results with synthetic and real data are presented.},

@article{Takeishi2015,
abstract = {In an asteroid exploration and sample return mission, accurate estimation of the shape and motion of the target asteroid is essential for selecting a touchdown site and navigating a spacecraft during touchdown operation. In this work, we present an automatic estimation method for the shape and motion of an asteroid, which is planned to be tested in future exploration missions including Japanese Hayabusa-2 [1]. Our task is to estimate the shape and rotation axis of the asteroid, as well as positions of the spacecraft from optical images. The proposed method is based on the expectation conditional-maximization (ECM) framework that consists of an auxiliary particle filter and nonlinear optimization techniques. One of our technical contributions is the estimation of the direction of rotation axis of the asteroid from monocular camera images, which are taken by the moving spacecraft. We conducted two experiments with synthetic data and an asteroid mock-up to show the validity of the proposed method and to present the numerical accuracy.},

Doesn't deal with the onboard processing, ports it to earth for batch calculations
Gives general algorithmic approach and math stuff},
