abstract = {Cast shadows are an informative cue to the shape of objects. They are particularly valuable for discovering object's concavities which are not available from other cues such as occluding boundaries. We propose a new method for recovering shape from shadows which we call shadow carving. Given a conservative estimate of the volume occupied by an object, it is possible to identify and carve away regions of this volume that are inconsistent with the observed pattern of shadows. We prove a theorem that guarantees that when these regions are carved away from the shape, the shape still remains conservative. Shadow carving overcomes limitations of previous studies on shape from shadows because it is robust with respect to errors in shadows detection and it allows the reconstruction of objects in the round, rather than just bas-reliefs. We propose a reconstruction system to recover shape from silhouettes and shadow carving. The silhouettes are used to reconstruct the initial conservative estimate of the object's shape and shadow carving is used to carve out the concavities. We have simulated our reconstruction system with a commercial rendering package to explore the design parameters and assess the accuracy of the reconstruction. We have also implemented our reconstruction scheme in a table-top system and present the results of scanning of several objects. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.},

abstract = {NASA'S Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft recently arrived at the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, a primitive body that represents the objects that may have brought prebiotic molecules and volatiles such as water to Earth1. Bennu is a low-albedo B-type asteroid2 that has been linked to organic-rich hydrated carbonaceous chondrites3. Such meteorites are altered by ejection from their parent body and contaminated by atmospheric entry and terrestrial microbes. Therefore, the primary mission objective is to return a sample of Bennu to Earth that is pristine—that is, not affected by these processes4. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of instruments to characterize Bennu's global properties, support the selection of a sampling site and document that site at a sub-centimetre scale5–11. Here we consider early OSIRIS-REx observations of Bennu to understand how the asteroid's properties compare to pre-encounter expectations and to assess the prospects for sample return. The bulk composition of Bennu appears to be hydrated and volatile-rich, as expected. However, in contrast to pre-encounter modelling of Bennu's thermal inertia12 and radar polarization ratios13—which indicated a generally smooth surface covered by centimetre-scale particles—resolved imaging reveals an unexpected surficial diversity. The albedo, texture, particle size and roughness are beyond the spacecraft design specifications. On the basis of our pre-encounter knowledge, we developed a sampling strategy to target 50-metre-diameter patches of loose regolith with grain sizes smaller than two centimetres4. We observe only a small number of apparently hazard-free regions, of the order of 5 to 20 metres in extent, the sampling of which poses a substantial challenge to mission success.},

abstract = {The shapes of asteroids reflect interplay between their interior properties and the processes responsible for their formation and evolution as they journey through the Solar System. Prior to the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security–Regolith Explorer) mission, Earth-based radar imaging gave an overview of (101955) Bennu's shape. Here we construct a high-resolution shape model from OSIRIS-REx images. We find that Bennu's top-like shape, considerable macroporosity and prominent surface boulders suggest that it is a rubble pile. High-standing, north–south ridges that extend from pole to pole, many long grooves and surface mass wasting indicate some low levels of internal friction and/or cohesion. Our shape model indicates that, similar to other top-shaped asteroids, Bennu formed by reaccumulation and underwent past periods of fast spin, which led to its current shape. Today, Bennu might follow a different evolutionary pathway, with an interior stiffness that permits surface cracking and mass wasting.},

abstract = {The autonomous approach of a spacecraft to an asteroid or comet (a small body) relies heavily on visual fea- ture tracking to aid in estimating relative trajectories and the properties of the small body. Feature tracking for small bodies brings several challenges, including changing lighting, poor visual texture, and a concentration of features in a small part of an image. Six existing, open-source algorithms for feature tracking were tested on a simulated dataset and compared to the ground truth in the path of features. The main finding is that none of the algorithms provide all of the desired characteristics of long feature tracks with low errors and few outliers. Instead, there is a trade-off between long feature tracks and low error. The feature-matching algorithms SIFT, and BRISK provide good error characteristics, but short feature tracks, whereas the optical flow algorithm KLT provides long feature tracks, but with many features of large error. Given the challenges in feature tracking, it is recommended to focus development on each component of a feature tracking system: detection, description, and outlier rejection.},

abstract = {Autonomous spacecraft navigation, or the ability of a spacecraft to navigate indepen- dent of Earth-based resources, is a topic of growing importance. Many important mission scenarios either require or would greatly benefit such a capability. An end-to-end study of navigation performance for two such scenarios is used to assess the viability of optical measurements as a solution to the problem of autonomous spacecraft navigation. In the first scenario, performance during a planetary y-by is assessed using real images taken during the MESSENGER spacecraft's June 2007 y-by of Venus. In the second scenario, performance during a lunar return is assessed using synthetically generated images of the Earth and Moon. {\textcopyright} 2010 by John A. Christian and E. Glenn Lightsey.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the characterization of small body surfaces with stereophotoclinometry are {\&} discussed. The principal data output is an ensemble of landmark maps (L-maps), high-resolution topography/albedo maps of varying resolution that tile the surface of the body. Because they can have a resolution comparable to the best images, and can be located on a global reference frame to high accuracy, L-maps provide a significant improvement in discriminatory power for studies of small bodies, ranging from regolith processes to interior structure. These techniques are now being used to map larger bodies such as the Moon and Mercury. L-maps are combined to produce a standard global topography model (GTM) with about 1.57 million vectors and having a wide variety of applications. They can also be combined to produce high-resolution topography maps that describe local areas with much greater detail than the GTM. When combined with nominal predictions from other data sources and available data from other instruments such as LIDAR or RADAR, solutions for the spacecraft position and camera pointing are the most accurate available. Examples are drawn from studies of Phobos, Eros, and Itokawa, including surface characterization, gravity analysis, spacecraft navigation, and incorporation of LIDAR or RADAR data. This work has important implications for potential future missions such as Deep Interior and the level of navigation and science that can be achieved. {\textcopyright} The Meteoritical Society, 2008.},

abstract = {Autonomous mapping and navigation around unknown small bodies is a challenging problem. In todays missions, small body mapping and navigation (SBMN) require significant human intervention on the ground for map refinement and supervision of the navigation and orbit selection process. Although current methodologies adequately performed in past missions (e.g., Rosetta, Hayabusa, Deep Space), they are not suitable for applications requiring a high level of autonomy. This work proposes a method for autonomous orbit selection and adaptation around a small body while mapping its surface. In particular, in this work, we will develop cost functions that quantify the orbit goodness in the sense of map improvement. In other words, we develop quantitative measures that characterize the accuracy of the small body map and use these measures in an optimization process to compute the next best orbit that maximally contributes to the map enhancement. The proposed framework reduces the human involvement in this process and takes a step toward the fully autonomous mapping and navigation around small bodies.},

abstract = {Improved measurement techniques allow quantitative testing of the physical significance of the shapes of small satellites such as the possible occurrence of equilibrium ellipsoid forms. Shapes of the small satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus have been measured using limb coordinates from spacecraft images. Limb-derived ellipsoidal models can measure volumes of irregular objects accurately: ellipsoidal models of Phobos and Deimos derived from limb coordinates are nearly identical to those obtained independently from stereogrammetry (Duxbury and Callahan 1988). These ellipsoidal approximations, however, are incomplete descriptions of the shapes of small satellites in that average residuals are much larger than measurement errors. Ellipsoidal models of eight small satellites compared with equilibrium ellipsoids show that shapes of even moderately irregular satellites are poor predictors of mean densities. Icy satellites smaller than mean radius (Rm) ≈ 150 km are irregularly shaped and have limb roughnesses of several percent of mean radius (RMS residuals .03-.08 Rm). There is no trend in roughness with size below Rm = 150 km. Larger icy satellites are ellipsoidal and have limb roughness below 0.01 Rm. "Rocky" satellites of Rm = 6-110 km are also irregularly shaped; the only larger rocky satellites are the Moon and Io (Rm = 1740 and 1820 km) which have roughnesses well below 0.01 Rm. Data on rocky satellites combined with published data for Ceres and Juno (Millis et al. 1981, 1987) suggest a gradual transition from irregular to ellipsoidal rocky objects. Limb topography and images suggest that the small satellites retain impact scars of diameter of up to 1.7 times the satellite mean radius. These large indentations are the primary difference in shape between small and large satellites. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel Shape from Silhouette (SfS) algorithm to estimate the physical and dynamical properties of a small body-such as an asteroid or comet-from periodic images taken from a distant approaching spacecraft. Standard mapping techniques such as Stereo-Photo-Clinometry (SPC) and Stereo-Photo-Grammetry (SPG) are designed for close-proximity observations in which the body is 1000s of pixels in area, and there are enough surface features on the object. In contrast, our algorithms are suited for distant observations (i.e. during first approach) in which the body is only 10s-100s of pixels in area and does not present any useful visual features. First, using the Fast-Fourier-Transform of the light curve of the small body, we estimate its rotation rate. Then, using our novel silhouette-based 3D shape reconstruction technique, we estimate the shape and size of the small body and its pole of rotation. In this paper, we assume that the small body is performing pure rotation (no tumbling) about its principal axis, that the Sun is directly behind the spacecraft, and that the distance from the spacecraft to the small body is known. These algorithms have been tested using both simulated data from Comet 67P, Asteroids Eros and Itokawa; and real data from the Rosetta mission.},

We propose a new hybrid approach which overcomes the precision-complexity trade-off inherent to voxel based approaches by taking advantage of surface based approaches. To this aim, we introduce a space discretization which does not rely on a regular grid, where most cells are ineffective, but rather on an irregular grid where sample points lie on the surface of the visual hull. Such a grid is composed of tetrahedral cells obtained by applying a Delaunay triangulation on the sample points. These cells are carved afterward according to image silhouette information. The proposed approach keeps the robustness of volumetric approaches while drastically improving their precision and reducing their time and space complexities. It thus allows modeling of objects with complex geometry, and it also makes real time feasible for precise models. Preliminary results with synthetic and real data are presented.},

abstract = {An integrated profram for spacecraft navigation and determination of small body dynamics, shape, and high-resolution topography is discussed. Multiple image stereography and photoclinometry (shape from shading) are used to construct high resolution topographic and albedo maps, whose centers are treated as control points. These landmark maps are re-illuminated and correlated with images to act as body-fixed navigation tie-points. Their limb projections are compared with observed limb profiles to better fix their locations and the spacecraft pointing and positionn. Maps are also correlated with overlapping maps to better determine their body-fixed locations. Finally, a set of overlapping maps covering the body's surface is used to construct a high-resolution model for the body's shape and topography. Assuming a homogeneous mass distribution, such a model can be used to determine gravity harmonics for orbit prediction. These procedures are applicable to any mission involving an extended orbital phase, such as NEAR, Dawn, Deep Interior, or MESSENGER. Eventually, landmark maps could be uploaded to the spacecraft to allow for autonomous optical navigation. As a proof of concept for the Dawn mission, a small sample ({\textless}2000 images) of the available data from the NEAR mission has been used to construct a shape and topography model for Eros. The model is less noisy than the laser altimetry result and, for a homogenous mass distribution, it correlates better with observed gravity harmonics.},

The most important decision ahead of the OSIRIS-REx team is the selection of a prime sample-site on the surface of asteroid (101955) Bennu. Mission success hinges on identifying a site that is safe and has regolith that can readily be ingested by the spacecraft's sampling mechanism. To inform this mission-critical decision, the surface of Bennu is mapped using the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite and the images are used to develop several foundational data products. Acquiring the necessary inputs to these data products requires observational strategies that are defined specifically to overcome the challenges associated with mapping a small irregular body. We present these strategies in the context of assessing candidate sample sites at Bennu according to a framework of decisions regarding the relative safety, sampleability, and scientific value across the asteroid's surface. To create data products that aid these assessments, we describe the best practices developed by the OSIRIS-REx team for image-based mapping of irregular small bodies. We emphasize the importance of using 3-D shape models and the ability to work in body-fixed rectangular coordinates when dealing with planetary surfaces that cannot be uniquely addressed by body-fixed latitude and longitude.},

abstract = {We introduce an algebraic dual-space method for reconstructing the visual hull of a three-dimensional object from occluding contours observed in 2D images. The method exploits the differential structure of the manifold rather than parallax geometry, and therefore requires no correspondences. We begin by observing mat the set of 2D contour tangents determines a surface in a dual space where each point represents a tangent plane to the original surface. The primal and dual surfaces have a symmetric algebra: A point on one is orthogonal to its dual point and tangent basis on the other. Thus the primal surface can be reconstructed if the local dual tangent basis can be estimated. Typically this is impossible because the dual surface is noisy and riddled with tangent singularities due to self-crossings. We identify a directionally-indexed local tangent basis that is well-defined and estimable everywhere on the dual surface. The estimation procedure handles singularities in the dual surface and degeneracies arising from measurement noise. The resulting method has O(N) complexity for N observed contour points and gives asymptotically exact reconstructions of surfaces that are totally observable from occluding contours.},

abstract = {As Earth-based radio tracking navigation is severely limited because of communications constraints and low relative navigation accuracy, autonomous optical navigation capabilities are essential for both robotic and manned deep-space exploration missions. Image processing is considered one of the key technologies for autonomous optical navigation to extract high-precision navigation observables from a raw image. New image processing algorithms for deep-space autonomous optical navigation are developed in this paper. First, multiple image pre-processing and the Canny edge detection algorithm are adopted to identify the edges of target celestial bodies and simultaneously remove the potential false edges. Secondly, two new limb profile fitting algorithms are proposed based on the Least Squares method and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, respectively, with the assumption that the perspective projection of a target celestial body on the image plane will form an ellipse. Next, the line-of-sight (LOS) vector from the spacecraft to the centroid of the observed object is obtained. This is taken as the navigation measurement observable and input to the navigation filter algorithm. Finally, the image processing algorithms developed in this paper are validated using both synthetic simulated images and real flight images from the MESSENGER mission.

abstract = {The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft launched on September 8, 2016 to embark on an asteroid sample return mission. It is expected to rendezvous with the asteroid, Bennu, navigate to the surface, collect a sample (July'20), and return the sample to Earth (September'23). The original mission design called for using one of two Flash Lidar units to provide autonomous navigation to the surface. Following Preliminary design and initial development of the Lidars, reliability issues with the hardware and test program prompted the project to begin development of an alternative navigation technique to be used as a backup to the Lidar. At the critical design review, Natural Feature Tracking (NFT) was added to the mission. NFT is an onboard optical navigation system that compares observed images to a set of asteroid terrain models which are rendered in real-time from a catalog stored in memory on the flight computer. Onboard knowledge of the spacecraft state is then updated by a Kalman filter using the measured residuals between the rendered reference images and the actual observed images. The asteroid terrain models used by NFT are built from a shape model generated from observations collected during earlier phases of the mission and include both terrain shape and albedo information about the asteroid surface. As a result, the success of NFT is dependent on selecting a set of topographic features that can be both identified during descent as well as reliably rendered using the shape model data available. During development, the OSIRIS-REx team faced significant challenges in developing a process conducive to robust operation. This was especially true for terrain models to be used as the spacecraft gets close to the asteroid and higher fidelity models are required for reliable image correlation. This paper will present some of the challenges and lessons learned from the development of the NFT system which includes not just the flight hardware and software but the development of the terrain models used to generate the onboard rendered images.},

abstract = {Small bodies exploration highlighted the need to develop new algorithms for deep space probes navigation. The limited knowledge of small bodies properties imposes numerous challenges in mission design and spacecraft operation. In particular, the time required for communication and the uncertainty on small body parameters estimation require the devel- opment and improvement of autonomous navigation and decision making. The estimation of the shape and rotation pole orientation in the inertial space is a crucial step for relative navigation and orbital frames definition, and an important milestone to in- vestigate the gravity field under the assumption of constant density. Current techniques rely on shape from shadowing, i.e. stereophotoclinometry, or shape from motion, i.e. stereopho- togrammetry. These approaches have been used since the beginning of asteroid exploration and, as a consequence, they have a high degree of reliability. Unfortunately, these algo- rithms cannot be used on board because of the extreme computational burden and the need of human-in-the-loop to control the convergence of the output solution. In the perspective of designing autonomous algorithms to enable navigation during the approach phase of small body missions, new solutions must be developed by limiting the needed data to the infor- mation available on board and by considering simpler algorithms that could be used without delayed communication with Earth. This paper develops a shape from silhouette algorithm that takes as input a series of polyg- onal silhouettes to construct a polyhedral shape. The shape is computed by intersecting the viewing cones, i.e. the cone defined by having the camera center as vertex and the silhouette points as part of the edges. The algorithm output is a polyhedral shape that can be used for preliminary gravitational characterization of the small body, under hypothesis of constant density, or in model-based tracking algorithms. Finally, numerical simulation are presented and commented to have an overview of the pro- posed algorithm.},

This research proposes and models this initial characterization via a series of slow flybys and analyzes how rapidly the gravity field can be estimated and the precision to which it can be determined. Two analytical issues are addressed in this paper that are pertinent to the design of this characterization process and can be used to evaluate whether there is a need for lidar measurements. A new operational procedure called $\Delta$V ranging is proposed, which can eliminate the need for lidar during the initial characterization phase. Following this, the characterization of the gravity field is addressed by performing a covariance analysis around three asteroids: Itokawa, Didymos, and Eros, representing a two-order-of-magnitude difference in size. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Y.

New observations are made regarding the effect of surface albedo and terrain on navigation performance. Furthermore, study of this problem led to a new subpixel edge localization algorithm using Zernike moments, which is found to outperform existing methods for accurately finding the horizon's location in an image. The new limb localization technique is discussed in detail, along with extensive comparisons with alternative approaches. Theoretical results are validated through a variety of numerical examples.},

The presented algorithm yielded a satisfying estimate of the shape model of interest (point-cloud-to-shape RMS residuals of 0.497 m), along with a consistent range error metric that was trained by means of likelihood maximization over the measured range residuals. The reconstructed shape model of asteroid Itokawa and its associated uncertainty metric were used by an iterated extended Kalman filter for navigation. The filter returned an estimate of the spacecraft state and asteroid attitude that was consistent with the covariance envelopes, despite the defects in the reconstructed shape.},
