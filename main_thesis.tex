\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

	Often the abstract will be long enough to require
	more than one page, in which case the macro
	``$\backslash$OnePageChapter'' should {\it not}
	be used.

	But this one isn't, so it should.
	}

\dedication[Dedication]{	% NEVER use \OnePageChapter here.
	I dedicate this manuscript to my Mom. Thank you for pushing me to strive for great things.

\acknowledgements{	\OnePageChapter	% *MUST* BE ONLY ONE PAGE!
	I'd like to acknowledge my tireless advisor, Jay McMahon, for bringing me into the ORCCA lab and letting me do whatever I wanted with my research while supporting me at every step along the way. I have many exciting opportunities ahead of me thanks to you. I am also very grateful to my committee members for their guidance and expertise which shapes this work. 
	I thank my colleagues in the ORCCA Lab and CCAR whose advice, collaboration, and kindness made this all possible. Lyss, you deserve the most recognition for your compassion and brilliance and without your friendship, I would not have made it through.
	I will also honorably mention my professors from the Coe College physics department, who pushed me to continue with my education and became my family in Iowa. Thank you Ugur, Mario, Doc, and Firdevs for your help and friendship. Your committment to student success and excellence in research is why I got to chase my dreams. 
	Thank you to my partner, Nicholas, for your patience and support as I approach graduation. I can't wait to support you through your own Ph.D. journey. Lastly, I want to thank my all of my family and friends who are reading this, for being there for me in all of the hard times.
