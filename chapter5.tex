\chapter{Ground-based Uncertainty based on Boulder Distributions}
\label{yorp_estimates}
%this chapter is going to be about how our model fits into the larger picture. What I need to do here is come up with the idea of what to write
                                                                                

\section{Asteroid YORP measured from ground}

\section{Comparison of current models and observations}

\section{Boulder-induced YORP variability analysis}

\section{Other sources of uncertainty}


%what do I need to do here?

%1 - good background investigation and reporting

%2 - comparison of statistics

%3 - find models that fit within the uncertainty ranges

%4 - acknowledge crater and tangential YORP
